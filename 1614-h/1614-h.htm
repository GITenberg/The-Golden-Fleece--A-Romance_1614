    <h2>
      CHAPTER I.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The professor crossed one long, lean leg over the other, and punched down
      the ashes in his pipe-bowl with the square tip of his middle finger. The
      thermometer on the shady veranda marked eighty-seven degrees of heat, and
      nature wooed the soul to languor and revery; but nothing could abate the
      energy of this bony sage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They talk about their Atlantises,&mdash;their submerged continents!&rdquo; he
      exclaimed, with a sniff through his wide, hairy nostrils. &ldquo;Why, Trednoke,
      do you realize that we are living literally at the bottom of a Mesozoic&mdash;at
      any rate, Cenozoic&mdash;sea?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman thus indignantly addressed contemplated his questioner with
      the serenity of one conscious of freedom from geologic responsibility. He
      was a man of about the professor&rsquo;s age,&mdash;say, sixty years,&mdash;but
      not like him in appearance. His figure was stately and massive,&mdash;that
      of one who in his youth must have possessed vast physical strength,
      rigidly developed and disciplined. Well set upon his broad shoulders was a
      noble head, crowned with gray, wavy hair; the eyes and eyebrows were black
      and powerful, but the expression was kindly and humorous. His moustache
      and the Roman convexity of his chin would have confirmed your conviction
      that he was a retired warrior; in which you would have been correct, for
      General Trednoke always appeared what he was, both outwardly and inwardly.
      His great frame, clad in white linen, was comfortably disposed in a
      Japanese straw arm-chair; yet there was a soldierly poise in his attitude.
      He was smoking a large and excellent cigar; and a cup of coffee, with a
      tiny glass of cognac beside it, stood on a mahogany stand at his elbow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you remember, Meschines, the time I licked you at school?&rdquo; he
      inquired, in a tone of pleasant reminiscence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say I do. What&rsquo;s more, I venture to challenge your statement. And
      though you are a hundred pounds the better of me in weight, and a West
      Point graduate, I will wager my pipe (which is worth its weight in
      diamonds) against that old woollen shirt of Montezuma&rsquo;s that you showed me
      yesterday, that I can lick you to-day, and forget all about it before
      bedtime!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I guess you could,&rdquo; returned the general, with a little chuckle,
      &ldquo;even if I hadn&rsquo;t that Mexican bullet in my leg. But you couldn&rsquo;t,
      forty-five years ago, though you tried, and though I was a year younger
      than you, and weighed five pounds less. Come, now: you don&rsquo;t mean to say
      you&rsquo;ve forgotten Susan Brown!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;ah&mdash;hah! Susan Brown! Well, I declare! And what brought her
      into your head, I should like to know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, after breaking your heart first, and then mine, I lost sight of her,
      and I don&rsquo;t think I have seen her since. But it appears she was married to
      a fellow named Parsloe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fancy that name!&rdquo; observed the professor, wagging his head and
      frowning. &ldquo;Has a mean sound to it. But what of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, she died,&mdash;rest her soul!&mdash;and Parsloe too. But they had
      a daughter, and she survives them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And resembles her mother, eh?&mdash;No, Trednoke, the time for that sort
      of thing has gone by with me. Susan might have had me, five-and-forty
      years ago; but I can&rsquo;t undertake to revive my passion for the benefit of
      Mrs. Parsloe&rsquo;s daughter. Besides, I&rsquo;m too busy to think of marriage, and
      not&mdash;not old enough!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this tour de force, the general laughed softly, and finished his
      coffee. An old Indian, somewhat remarkable in appearance, with shaggy
      white hair hanging down on his shoulders, stepped forward from the room
      where he had been waiting, and removed the cup.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No letters yet, Kamaiakan?&rdquo; asked the general, in Spanish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a few minutes, general,&rdquo; the other replied. &ldquo;Pablo has just come in
      sight over the hill. There were several errands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Muy buen!&mdash;I was going to say, Meschines, her father and mother left
      the girl poor, and she, being, apparently, clever and energetic, took to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know!&rdquo; the professor interrupted. &ldquo;They all do it, when they are clever
      and energetic, and that&rsquo;s the end of them!&mdash;School-teaching!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; returned General Trednoke. &ldquo;She entered a dry-goods store.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Entered a dry-goods store! Well, there&rsquo;s nothing so extraordinary in
      that. I&rsquo;ve seen quantities of women do it, of all ages, colors, and
      degrees. What did she buy there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, a fiddlestick!&rdquo; exclaimed the general. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you keep quiet and
      listen to my story? I say, she went into a great dry-goods store in New
      York, as sales-woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless my soul! You don&rsquo;t mean a shop-girl?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I said, isn&rsquo;t it? And why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well!&mdash;but, shade of Susan Brown! Ichabod!&mdash;what is the
      feminine of Ichabod, by the way, Trednoke? But, seriously, it&rsquo;s too bad.
      Susan may have been fickle, but she was always aristocratic. And now her
      daughter is a shop-girl. You and I are avenged!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are just as ridiculous, Meschines, as you were thirty or fifty years
      ago,&rdquo; said the general, tranquilly. &ldquo;You declaim for the sake of hearing
      your own voice. Besides, what you say is un-American. Grace Parsloe, as I
      was saying, got a place as shop-girl in one of the great New York stores.
      I don&rsquo;t say she mightn&rsquo;t have done worse: what I say is, I doubt whether
      she could have done better. That house&mdash;I know one of its founders,
      and I know what I&rsquo;m talking about&mdash;is like an enormous family, where
      children are born, year after year, grow up, and take their places in life
      according to their quality and merit. What I mean is, that the boy who
      drives a wagon for them to-day, at three dollars a week, may control one
      of their chief departments, or even become a partner, before they&rsquo;re done
      with him; and, mutatis mutandis, the same with the girls. When these girls
      marry, it&rsquo;s apt to be into a higher rank of life than they were born in;
      and that fact, I take it, is a good indication that their shop-girl
      experience has been an education and an improvement. They are given work
      to do, suited to their capacity, be it small or great; they are in the way
      of learning something of the great economic laws; they learn
      self-restraint, courtesy, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And human nature! Yes, poor things: they see the American buying-woman,
      and that is a discipline more trying than any you West Pointers know
      about! Oh, yes, I see your point. If the fathers of the big family ARE
      fathers, and the children ARE children to them... All the same, I fancy
      the young ladies, when they marry into the higher social circles, as you
      say they do, don&rsquo;t, as a rule, make their shop girl days a topic of
      conversation at five-o&rsquo;clock teas, or put &lsquo;Ex-shop-girl to So-and-so&rsquo; at
      the bottom of their visiting-cards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe, after all, you&rsquo;re a snob, Meschines,&rdquo; said the general,
      pensively. &ldquo;But, as I was about to say, when you interrupted me ten
      minutes ago, Grace Parsloe is coming on here to make us a visit. She fell
      ill, and her employers, after doing what could be done for her in the way
      of medical attendance, made up their minds to give her a change of
      climate. Now, you know, as she had originally gone to them with a letter
      from me, and as I live out here, on the borders of the Southern desert, in
      a climate that has no equal, they naturally thought of writing to me about
      it. And of course I said I&rsquo;d be delighted to have her here, for a month,
      or a year, or whatever time it may be. She will be a pleasure to me, and a
      friend for Miriam, and she may find a husband somewhere up or down the
      coast, who will give her a fortune, and think all the better of her
      because she, like him, had the ability and the pluck to make her own way
      in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph! When do you expect her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She may turn up any day. She is coming round by way of the Isthmus. From
      what I hear, she is really a very fine, clever girl. She held a
      responsible position in the shop, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, let us sink the shop, and get back to the rational and instructive
      conversation that we&mdash;or, to be more accurate, that I was engaged in
      when this digression began. I presume you are aware that all the
      indications are lacustrine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hereupon, a hammock, suspended near the talkers, and filled with what
      appeared to be a bundle of lace and silken shawls, became agitated, and
      developed at one end a slender arched foot in an open-work silk stocking
      and sandal-slipper, and at the other end a dark, youthful, oval face, with
      glorious eyes and dull black hair. A voice of music asked,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is lacustrine, papa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, so you are awake again, Senorita Miriam?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t been asleep. What is lacustrine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask the professor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lacus, you know, my dear,&rdquo; said the latter, &ldquo;means fresh-water
      indications as against salt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then how does Great Salt Lake&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, for that matter, the whole ocean was fresh originally. Moisture,
      evaporation, precipitation. Water is a great solvent: earthquakes break
      the crust, and there you are!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, before the earthquakes, the Salt Lakes were fresh?&rdquo; rejoined the
      hammock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was fresh water west of the Rockies and south of&mdash;&mdash;
      Why,&rdquo; cried the professor, interrupting himself, &ldquo;when I was in Wyoming
      and around there, this spring, in what they call the Bad Lands,&mdash;cliffs
      and buttes of indurated yellow clay and sandstone, worn and carved out by
      floods long before the Aztecs started to move out of Canada,&mdash;I saw
      fossil bones sticking out of the cliffs, the least of which would make the
      fortune of a museum. That was between the Rockies and the Wahsatch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;People&rsquo;s bones?&rdquo; asked the hammock, agitating itself again, and showing a
      glimpse of a smooth throat and a slender ankle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless my soul! If there were people in those days they must have had an
      anxious time of it!&rdquo; returned the sage. &ldquo;No, no, my dear. There was
      brontosaurus, and atlantosaurus, and hydrosaurus, and iguanodon,&mdash;lizards,
      you know, not like these little black fellows that run about in the
      pulverized feldspar here, but chaps eighty or a hundred feet long, and
      twenty or thirty high; and turtles, as big as a house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did they get there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Got mired while they were feeding, perhaps; or the water drained off and
      left them high and dry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But where did the water go to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The general chuckled at this juncture, and lit another cigar. &ldquo;She knows
      more questions than you do the answers to them,&rdquo; quoth he. &ldquo;But I wouldn&rsquo;t
      mind hearing where the water went to, myself. I should like to see some of
      it back again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask the earthquakes, and the sun. There&rsquo;s a hundred and thirty degrees of
      heat in some of these valleys,&mdash;abysses, rather, three or four
      hundred feet below sea-level. The earth is very thin-skinned in this
      region, too, and whatever water wasn&rsquo;t evaporated from above would be
      likely to come to grief underneath.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, professor,&rdquo; said the musical voice, &ldquo;I thought there was a law that
      water always seeks its own level. So how can there be empty places below
      sea-level?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the fault of the aneroid barometer, my dear. We were very
      comfortable and commonplace until that came along and revealed anomalies.
      The secret lies, I suppose, in the trend of the strata, which is generally
      north and south. You see the ridges cropping out all through the desert;
      and there&rsquo;s a good deal of lava oozing over them, too. They probably act
      as walls, to prevent the sea getting in from the west, or the Colorado
      leaking in from the east.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; remarked the general, &ldquo;a little more seismic disturbance
      might produce a change.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would have to be more than a little, I suspect,&rdquo; returned Meschines.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kamaiakan told me that the Indians have a prophecy that a great lake will
      come back and make the desert fruitful, and that there are some who know
      the very place where the water will begin to flow.&rdquo; And here the hammock,
      with a final convulsion, gave birth to a beautiful young woman, in a
      diaphanous silk dress and a white lace mantilla. She crossed the veranda,
      and seated herself on the broad arm of her father&rsquo;s chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, that&rsquo;s important!&rdquo; said the general, arching his brows. &ldquo;I wonder if
      Kamaiakan is one of those who know the place? If so, it might be worth his
      while to let me into the secret.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you couldn&rsquo;t go there! It&rsquo;s enchanted, and people who go near it die.
      There are bones all about there, now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This Kamaiakan appears to be a remarkable personage: where did you pick
      him up?&rdquo; inquired the professor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was rather the other way,&rdquo; Trednoke replied, taking one of his
      daughter&rsquo;s hands in his, and caressing it. &ldquo;We are appendages to
      Kamaiakan. You look so natural, sitting there, Meschines, that I forget
      it&rsquo;s thirty years since we met, and that all the significant events of my
      life have happened in that time,&mdash;the Mexican war, my marriage, and
      the rest of it! I have been a widower ten years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ve been a bachelor for over sixty!&rdquo; said Meschines, with a queer
      expression. &ldquo;Your wife was Spanish, was she not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her father was a Mexican of Andalusian descent. But her mother was
      descended from the race of Azatlan: there are records and relics
      indicating that her ancestors were princes in Tenochtitlan before Cortez
      made trouble there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ve been losing my heart to a princess, and never realized my
      audacity!&rdquo; exclaimed the professor, laying his hand on his waistcoat and
      making an obeisance to Miriam.
    </p>
    <p>
      She tossed her free foot, and played with the fringe of her reboso.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will tell my maid to look for it,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;but I think you must have
      left it in papa&rsquo;s curiosity-room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No: I&rsquo;m an Aztec sacrifice!&rdquo; cried the professor; and they all laughed.
      &ldquo;One would hardly have anticipated,&rdquo; he resumed after a pause, addressing
      Trednoke, &ldquo;that you would have made a double conquest,&mdash;first of the
      men, and then of the woman!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The woman conquered me, without trying or wishing to, and then, because
      she was a woman, took compassion on me. Whether my country has benefited
      much by the Mexican annexation, I can&rsquo;t say; but I know Inez&mdash;made a
      heaven on earth for me,&rdquo; concluded the general, in a low voice. His
      countenance, at this moment, wore a solemn and humble expression,
      beautiful to see; and Miriam bent and laid her cheek against his.
      Meschines knocked the ashes out of his pipe, and sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No woman ever took compassion on me,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;and you see the
      result,&mdash;ashes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ashes,&mdash;with their wonted fires living in them,&rdquo; said Trednoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were talking about this Indian of yours,&rdquo; said Meschines.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, to be sure. Well, he was attached to Inez&rsquo;s family when I first knew
      them. It was a peculiar relation; not like that of a servant. One finds
      such things in Mexico. The conquered race were of as good strain as their
      conquerors; the blood of Montezuma was as blue as the best of the
      Castilian. There were many intermarriages; and there are many instances of
      the survival of traditions and records; though the records are often
      symbolic, and would have no meaning to persons not initiated. But they
      have been sufficient to perpetuate ties of a personal nature through
      generation after generation; and the alliance between Kamaiakan and Inez
      was of this kind. His forefathers, I imagine, were priests, and priests
      were a mighty power in Tenochtitlan. For aught I know, indeed Kamaiakan
      may be an original priest of Montezuma&rsquo;s; no one knows his age, but he
      does not look an hour older, to-day, than when I first saw him, over
      twenty years ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He must be!&rdquo; said Miriam, with some positiveness. &ldquo;He has told me of
      seeing and doing things hundreds of years ago. And he says&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
       She paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does he say, Nina adorada?&rdquo; asked her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was about the treasure, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us hear. The professor is one of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s one of our traditions that my mother&rsquo;s ancestors, at the time of
      Cortez, were very rich people,&rdquo; continued Miriam, glancing at Meschines,
      and then letting her eyes wander across the garden, blooming with roses
      and fragrant with orange-trees, and so across the trellised vines towards
      the soft outline of the mountains eastward. &ldquo;A great part of their wealth
      was in the form of jewels and precious stones. When Cortez took the city,
      one of the priests, who was a relative of our family, put the jewels in a
      box, and hid them in a certain place in the desert.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And does Kamaiakan know where the place is?&rdquo; asked the general.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He can know, when the time comes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which will be, perhaps, when you are ready for your dowry,&rdquo; observed the
      professor, genially.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A spell was put upon the spot,&rdquo; Miriam went on, with a certain
      imaginative seriousness; for she loved romance and mystery so well, and
      was of a temperament so poetical, that the wildest fairy-tales had a sort
      of reality for her. &ldquo;No one can find the treasure while the spell remains.
      But Kamaiakan understands the spell, and the conjuration which dissolves
      it; and when he dissolves it, the treasure will be found.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, between ourselves,&rdquo; added the general, &ldquo;Kamaiakan is himself the
      priestly relative by whom the spell was wrought. He bears an enchanted
      life, which cannot cease until he has restored the jewels to Miriam&rsquo;s
      hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There might be something in it, you know,&rdquo; said Meschines, after a pause.
      &ldquo;The treasures of Montezuma have never been found. Is there no old chart
      or writing, in your collection of curiosities and relics, that might throw
      light on it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The scriptures of Anahuac were of the hieroglyphic type,&mdash;picture-writing,&rdquo;
       replied the other. &ldquo;No, I fear there is nothing to the purpose; and if
      there were, I shouldn&rsquo;t know how to decipher it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, papa, the tunic!&rdquo; exclaimed Miriam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! has the tunic anything to do with it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that the queer woollen garment with the gold embroidery?&rdquo; inquired the
      professor, becoming more interested. &ldquo;I took a fancy to that, you
      remember. Has it a story?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it is a kind of an anomaly, I believe,&rdquo; the general answered,
      looking up at his daughter with a smile. &ldquo;The Aztecs, you are aware,
      dressed chiefly in cotton. Even their defensive armor was of cotton,
      thickly quilted. Their ornaments were feathers, and embroidery of gold and
      precious stones. But wool, for some reason, they didn&rsquo;t wear; and yet this
      garment, as you can see for yourself, is pure wool; and that it is also
      pure Aztecan is beyond question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Admitting that, what clue does it give to the treasure?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must ask Kamaiakan,&rdquo; said Miriam: &ldquo;only, he wouldn&rsquo;t tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Possibly,&rdquo; the professor suggested, &ldquo;the place where the treasure is
      hidden is the place whence the water is to flow out; and the water is the
      treasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seriously, do you suppose that such a phenomenon as the return of an
      inland sea is physically practicable?&rdquo; asked Trednoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No phenomenon, in this part of the world, would surprise me,&rdquo; returned
      Meschines. &ldquo;The Colorado might break its barriers; or it is conceivable
      that some huge stream, taking its rise in the heights hundreds of miles
      north and east of us, may be flowing through subterranean passages into
      the sea, emerging from the sea-bottom hundreds of miles to the westward.
      Now, if a rattling good earthquake were to happen along, you might awake
      in the morning to find yourself on an island, or even under water.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A moderate Mediterranean would satisfy me,&rdquo; the general said. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t
      exchange the certainty of it for the treasures of Montezuma.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The thirst for gold and for water are synonymous in your case?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give this section a moist climate, and I needn&rsquo;t tell you that the Great
      American Desert would literally blossom as the rose. Even as it is, I
      expect a great deal of it will be redeemed by scientific irrigation. The
      soil only needs water to become inexhaustibly productive. Our desert, as
      you know, is not sand, like parts of the Sahara; it has all the
      ingredients that go to nourish plants, only their present powdery
      condition makes them unavailable. Now, I can, to-day, buy a hundred square
      miles of desert for a few dollars. You see the point, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And all you want is expert opinion as to the likelihood of finding
      water?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man who solves that question for me in the affirmative is welcome to
      half my share of the results that would ensue from it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you engage some expert to investigate?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One can&rsquo;t always trust an expert. I don&rsquo;t mean as to his expertness only,
      but as to his good faith. He might prefer to sell the idea to somebody who
      could pay cash,&mdash;which I cannot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you seem to have given this thing a good deal of thought, Trednoke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, yes: it has been my hobby for a year past; and I have made some
      investigations myself. But this is the first time I have spoken of it to
      any one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand. And what of the investigations?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can say that I found enough to interest me. I&rsquo;ll tell you about it some
      time. I should be glad to leave Miriam something to make her independent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should say that her Creator had already done that!&rdquo; said Meschines. &ldquo;By
      the way, I know a young fellow&mdash;if he were only here&mdash;who is
      just the man you want, and can be trusted. He&rsquo;s a civil engineer,&mdash;Harvey
      Freeman: the Lord only knows in what part of the world he is at this
      speaking. He has made a special study of these subterranean matters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you remember, papa, Coleridge&rsquo;s poem of Kubla Khan?&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Where Alph, the sacred river, ran
     Through caverns measureless to man
          Down to a sunless sea!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our sacred river, when we find it, shall be named Miriam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It ought to be Kamaiakan,&rdquo; she rejoined; &ldquo;for, if anybody finds it, it
      will be he.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I hear the wings of the angel of whom we have been speaking,&rdquo;
       said the general. &ldquo;Yes, here he is; and he has got the letters. Let us
      see! One for you Meschines. And this, I see, is from our friend Miss
      Parsloe, postmarked Santa Barbara. Why, she&rsquo;ll be here to-morrow, at that
      rate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a queer coincidence!&rdquo; exclaimed the professor, who had meanwhile
      opened his envelope and glanced through the contents. &ldquo;The very man I was
      speaking of,&mdash;Harvey Freeman! Says he is in this neighborhood, has
      heard I&rsquo;m here, and is coming down to pay me a visit. Methinks I hear the
      rolling of the sacred river!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you won&rsquo;t mention it to him, until&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless me! Of course not. I&rsquo;ll bring him over here, in the course of human
      events, and you can take a look at him, and act on your own intuitions. I
      won&rsquo;t say on Princess Miriam&rsquo;s, for Harvey is a very fine-looking fellow,
      and her intuitions might get confused.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A civil engineer!&rdquo; said Miriam, with an intonation worthy of the daughter
      of a West-Pointer and the descendant of an Aztec prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kamaiakan (who spoke only Spanish) had been gathering up some cushions
      that had fallen out of the hammock. Having replaced them, and cast a quick
      glance at Meschines, he withdrew.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Southern Pacific Railway passes, today, not far from the site of
      General Trednoke&rsquo;s ranch. But the events now to be narrated occurred some
      years before the era of transcontinental railroads: they were in the air,
      but not yet bolted down to the earth. The general, therefore, was a
      pioneer, and was by no means overrun with friends from the East in search
      of an agreeable winter climate. The easiest way to reach him&mdash;if you
      were not pressed for time&mdash;was round the cape which forms the
      southernmost point of South America and sticks its sharp snout inquiringly
      into the Antarctic solitudes, as if it scented something questionable
      there. The speediest route, though open to strange discomforts, was by way
      of the Isthmus; and then there were always the saddle, the wagon, and the
      stage, with the accompaniments of road-agents, tornadoes, deserts, and
      starvation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Grace Parsloe came via the Isthmus; and the latter part of her
      journey had been alleviated by the society of a young gentleman from New
      York, Freeman by name. There were other passengers on the vessel; but
      these two discovered sympathies of origin and education which made
      companionship natural. They sat together at table, leaned side by side
      over the taffrail, discussed their fellow-travellers, and investigated
      each other. As he lolled on the bench with folded arms and straw hat
      tilted back from his forehead she, glancing side-long, as her manner was,
      saw a sunburnt aquiline nose, a moustache of a lighter brown than the
      visage which it decorated, a lean, strong jaw, and a muscular neck. His
      forehead, square and impending, was as white as ivory in comparison with
      the face below; his hair, in accordance with the fashion introduced by the
      late war, was cropped close. But what especially moved Miss Grace were
      those long, lazy blue eyes, which seemed to tolerate everything, but to be
      interested in nothing,&mdash;hardly even in her. Now, Grace could not help
      knowing she was a pretty girl, and it was somewhat of a novelty to her
      that Freeman should appear so indifferent. It would have been difficult to
      devise a better opportunity than this to monopolize masculine admiration,
      and she fell to speculating as to what sort of an experience Mr. Freeman
      must have had, so to panoply him against her magic. On the other hand, she
      was the recipient of whatever attentions he could bring himself to detach
      from the horizon-line, or from his own thoughts (which appeared to amount,
      practically, to about the same thing). She had no other rivals; and a
      woman will submit amiably to a good deal of indifference, provided she be
      assured that no other woman is enjoying what she lacks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Freeman, for his part, had nothing to complain of. Grace Parsloe was a
      singularly pretty girl. Singular properly qualifies her. She was not like
      the others,&mdash;by which phrase he epitomized the numerous comely young
      women whom he had, at various times and in several countries, attended,
      teased, and kissed. Both physically and mentally, she was very
      fine-wrought. Her bones were small; her body and limbs were slender, but
      beautifully fashioned. She was supple and vigorous. Grace is a product of
      brain as well as an effect of bodily symmetry: Grace had the quality on
      both counts. She answered to one&rsquo;s conception of Mahomet&rsquo;s houris,
      assuming that the conception is not of a fat person. Her head was small,
      but well proportioned,&mdash;compact as to the forehead, rather broad
      across the cheek-bones, thence tapering to the chin. Her eyes were blue,
      but of an Eastern strangeness of shape and setting; they were subject to
      great and sudden changes of expression, depending, apparently, on the
      varying state of her emotions, and betraying an intensity more akin to the
      Oriental temperament than to ours. There was in her something subtle and
      fierce; yet overlaying it, like a smooth and silken skin, were the
      conventional polish and bearing of an American school graduate. She was,
      in deed, noticeably artificial and self-conscious in manner and in the
      intonations of her speech; though it was an aesthetic delight to see her
      move or pose, and the quality of her voice was music&rsquo;s self. But Freeman,
      after due meditation, came to the conclusion that this was the outcome of
      her recognition of her own singularity: in trying to be like other people,
      she fell into caricature. Freeman, somehow, liked her the better for it.
      Like most men of brain and pith, who have seen and thought much, he was
      thankful for a new thing, because, so far as it went, it renewed him. It
      pleased him to imagine that he could, with a word or a look, cause this
      veil of artifice to be thrown aside, and the primitive passion and
      fierceness behind it to start forth. He allowed himself to imagine, with a
      certain satisfaction, that were he to make this young woman jealous she
      would think nothing of thrusting a dagger between his ribs. Reality,&mdash;what
      a delight it is! The actual touch and feeling of the spontaneous natural
      creature have been so buried beneath centuries of hypocrisy and humbug
      that we have ceased to believe in them save as a metaphysical abstraction.
      But even as water, long depressed under-ground in perverse channels,
      surges up to the surface, and above it, at last, in a fountain of relief,
      so Nature, after enduring ages of outrage and banishment, leaps back to
      her rightful domain in some individual whom we call extraordinary because
      he or she is natural. Grace Parsloe did not seem (regarded as to her
      temperament and quality) to belong where she was: therefore she was a
      delightful incident there. Had she been met with in the days of the Old
      Testament, or in the depths of Persia or India at the present time, even,
      she might have appeared commonplace. But here she was in conventional
      costume, with conventional manners. And, just as the nautch-girls, and
      other Oriental dancers and posturers, wear a costume which suggests nature
      more effectively than does nature itself, so did Grace&rsquo;s conventionality
      suggest to Freeman the essential absence of conventionality more forcibly
      than if he had seen her clad in a turban and translucent caftan, dancing
      off John the Baptist&rsquo;s head, or driving a nail into that of Sisera. Grace
      certainly owed much of her importance to her situation, which rendered her
      foreign and piquante. But, then, everything, in this world, is relative.
    </p>
    <p>
      Racial types seem to be a failure: when they become very marked, the race
      deteriorates or vanishes. In the counties of England, after only a
      thousand years, the women you meet in the rural districts and country
      towns all look like sisters. The Asiatics, of course, are much more sunk
      in type than the Anglo-Saxons; and they show us the way we would be going.
      Only, there is hope in rapid transit and the cosmopolitan spirit, and
      especially in these United States, which bring together the ends of the
      earth, and place side by side a descendant of the Puritans like Freeman,
      and a daughter of Irak-Ajemi.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you coming to California for, Mr. Freeman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Freeman had already told her what he had been in the Isthmus for,&mdash;to
      paddle in miasmatic swamps with a view to the possibility of a canal in
      the remote, speculative future. He had given her a graphic and
      entertaining picture of the hideous and inconceivable life he had led
      there for six months, from which he had emerged the only member of a party
      of nineteen (whites, blacks, and yellows) who was not either dead by
      disease, by violence, or by misadventure, or had barely escaped with life
      and a shattered constitution. Freeman, after emerging from the miasmatic
      hell and lake of Gehenna, had taken a succession of baths, with soap and
      friction, had been attended by a barber and a tailor, and had himself
      attended the best table to be found for love or money in the charming town
      of Panama. He had also spent more than half of the week of his sojourn
      there in sleep; and he was now in the best possible condition, physical
      and mental,&mdash;though not, he admitted, pecuniary. As to morals, they
      had not reached that discussion yet. But, in all that he did say, Freeman
      exhibited perfect unreserve and frankness, answering without hesitation or
      embarrassment any question she chose to ask (and she asked some curious
      ones).
    </p>
    <p>
      But when she asked him such an innocent thing as what he was after in
      California&mdash;an inquiry, by the way, put more in idleness than out of
      curiosity&mdash;Freeman stroked his yellow moustache with the thumb of the
      hand that held his Cuban cigarette, gazed with narrowed eyelids at the
      horizon, and for some time made no reply at all. Finally he said that
      California was a place he had never visited, and that it would be a pity
      to have been so near it and yet not have improved the opportunity of
      taking a look at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grace instantly scented a mystery, and was not less promptly resolved to
      fathom it. And what must be the nature of a mystery attaching to a
      handsome man, unmarried, and evidently no stranger to the gentler sex? Of
      course there must be a woman in it! Her eyes glowed with azure fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have some acquaintances in California, I suppose?&rdquo; she said, with an
      air of laborious indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&mdash;yes; I believe I have,&rdquo; Freeman admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have they lived there long?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; not over a few months. I accidentally heard from a person in Panama.
      I dropped a line to say I might turn up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&mdash;&mdash;you haven&rsquo;t had time to get an answer, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Freeman inhaled a deep breath through his cigarette, tilted his head back,
      and allowed the smoke to escape slowly through his nostrils. In this
      manner, familiar to his deep-designing sex, he concealed a smile. Grace
      was, in some respects, as transparent as she was subtle. So long as the
      matter in hand did not touch her emotions, she had no difficulty in
      maintaining a deceptive surface; but emotion she could not disguise,
      though she was probably not aware of the fact; for emotion has a tendency
      to shut one&rsquo;s own eyes and open what they can no longer see in one&rsquo;s self
      to the gaze of outsiders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, when he had recovered his composure. &ldquo;But that won&rsquo;t make
      any difference. We are on rather intimate terms, you see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Is it long since you have met?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty long; at least it seems so to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grace turned, and looked full at her companion. He did not meet her
      glance, but kept his profile steadily opposed, and went on smoking with a
      dreamy air, as if lost in memories and anticipations, sad, yet sweet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, Mr. Freeman, I hardly thought&mdash;you have always seemed to
      care so little about anything&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t suspect you of so much
      sentiment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am like other men,&rdquo; he returned, with a sigh. &ldquo;My affections are not
      given indiscriminately; but when they are given,&mdash;you understand,&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I understand: pray don&rsquo;t think it necessary to explain. I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m
      very far from wishing to listen to confidences about another,&mdash;to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but I like to talk about it,&rdquo; interposed Freeman, earnestly. &ldquo;I
      haven&rsquo;t had a chance to open my heart, you know, for at least six months.
      And though you and I haven&rsquo;t known each other long, I believe you to be
      capable of appreciating what a man feels when he is on his way to meet
      some one who&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you! You are most considerate! But I shall be additionally obliged
      if you would tell me in what respect I can have so far forgotten myself as
      to lead you to think me likely to appreciate anything of the kind. I
      assure you, Mr. Freeman, I have never cared for any one; and nothing I
      have seen since I left home makes it probable that I shall begin now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry to hear that,&rdquo; said Freeman, slowly drawing another cigarette
      out of his bundle, and beginning to re-roll it with a dejected air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes: the fact is, I had hoped that you had begun to have a little
      friendly feeling for me. I am more than ready to reciprocate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you will spare me any insults, sir. I have no one to protect me,
      but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I assure you, I mean no insult. You cannot help knowing that I think you
      as beautiful and fascinating a woman as I have ever met; but of course you
      can&rsquo;t help being beautiful and fascinating. Do I insult you by having
      eyes? If so, I am sorry, but you will have to make the best of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With this, he turned in his seat, and calmly confronted her. Beautiful she
      certainly was, at that moment; but it was the beauty of an angry serpent.
      She had a pencil in her hand, with which, a little while before, she had
      been sketching heads of some of the passengers in her little notebook. She
      was now handling this inoffensive object in such a way as to justify the
      fancy that, had it been charged with a deadly poison in its point, instead
      of with a bit of plumbago of the HH quality, she would have driven it into
      Freeman&rsquo;s heart then and there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it no insult,&rdquo; said she, in a sibilant voice, &ldquo;to talk to me as you
      are doing, when you have just told me that you love another woman, and are
      going to meet her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Freeman&rsquo;s brows gradually knitted themselves in a frown of apparent
      perplexity. &ldquo;I must say I don&rsquo;t understand you,&rdquo; he observed, at length.
      &ldquo;I am quite sure I have said nothing of the sort. How could I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you wish to quibble about words, perhaps not. But was not that your
      meaning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it wasn&rsquo;t. You are the only woman who has been in my thoughts
      to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Freeman!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have intimated very clearly that you are engaged&mdash;married, for
      aught I know&mdash;to a woman whom you are now on your way to meet&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this point she stopped. Freeman had interrupted her with a shout of
      laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had been very pale. She now flushed all over her face, and jumped to
      her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; he said, laying a hand on her dress and (aided by a lurch of
      the vessel) pulling her into her seat again, &ldquo;and listen to me. And then I
      shall insist upon an apology. This is too much!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall ask the captain&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will not, I promise you. Look here! When I was in Panama, I met there
      a fellow I used to know in New York. He told me that he had recently
      crossed the continent with Professor Meschines, who used to teach geology
      and botany at Yale College, when he and I were students there. The
      professor had come over partly for the fun of the thing, and partly to
      look for specimens in the line of his profession. My friend parted from
      him at San Francisco: the professor was going farther south.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has all this to do with the woman who&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has this to do with it,&mdash;that the professor is the woman! He is
      over sixty years old, and has always been a good friend of mine; but I am
      not going to marry him. I am not engaged to him, he is not beautiful, nor
      even fascinating, except in the way of an elderly man of science. And he
      is the only human being, besides yourself, that I know or have ever heard
      of on the Pacific coast. Now for your apology!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grace emitted a long breath, and sank back in her seat, with her hands
      clasped in her lap. She raised her hands and covered her face with them.
      She removed them, sat erect, and bent an open-eyed, intent gaze upon her
      companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this pantomime, she exclaimed, in the lowest and most musical of
      tones, &ldquo;Oh! how hateful you are!&rdquo; Then she cried out with animation, &ldquo;I
      believe you did it on purpose!&rdquo; Finally, she sank back again, with a soft
      laugh and sparkling eyes, at the same time stretching out her right arm
      towards him and placing her hand on his, with a whispered, &ldquo;There, then!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Freeman, accepting the hand for the apology, kissed it, and continued to
      hold it afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I not a little goose?&rdquo; she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You certainly are,&rdquo; replied Freeman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t hold my hand any more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to withdraw your apology?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;N&mdash;no; but it doesn&rsquo;t follow that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, it does. Besides, when a man receives such a delicate, refined,
      graceful, exquisite apology as this,&rdquo;&mdash;here he lifted the hand,
      looked at it critically, and bestowed another kiss upon it,&mdash;&ldquo;he
      would be a fool not to make the most of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;re dangerous. You are well named&mdash;Freeman!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name is Harvey: won&rsquo;t you call me by it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I can&rsquo;t!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Try! Would it make it easier if I were to call you by yours?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mine is Miss Parsloe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh! How can that be your name which you are going to change so soon?
      When I look at you, I see your name; when I think of you, I say it to
      myself,&mdash;Grace!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know I am going to change my name soon&mdash;or ever?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whom are you talking to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To you,&mdash;Harvey! Oh!&rdquo; She snatched her hand away and pressed it over
      her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do I know you are beautiful, Grace, and&mdash;irresistible?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not! You&rsquo;re making fun of me! Besides, I&rsquo;m twenty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How many times have you been engaged?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never. Nobody wants to be engaged to a poor girl. Oh me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know what you are made of, Grace? Fire and flowers! Few men in the
      world are men enough to be a match for you. But what have you been doing
      with yourself all this time? Why do you come to a place like this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe I had a presentiment that... What nonsense we are talking! But what
      you said reminds me. It&rsquo;s the strangest coincidence!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Professor Meschines&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary, he is a most matter-of-fact old gentleman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do be quiet, and listen to me! When my mamma was a girl in school, there
      were two boys there,&mdash;it was a boy-and-girls&rsquo; school,&mdash;and they
      were great friends. But they both fell in love with my mamma&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can understand that,&rdquo; put in Freeman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know I am like my mamma? Well, as I was saying, they both fell
      in love with her, and quarrelled with each other, and had a fight. The boy
      that won the fight is the man to whose house I am going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he didn&rsquo;t marry your mamma?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no; that was only a childish affair, and she married another man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The one who got thrashed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not. But the one who got thrashed is your Professor Meschines.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see! The poor old professor! And he has remained a bachelor all his
      life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mamma has often told me the story, and that the Trednoke boy went to West
      Point, and distinguished himself in the Mexican war, and married a Mexican
      woman, and the Meschines boy became a professor in Yale College. And now I
      am going to see one of them, and you to see the other. Isn&rsquo;t that a
      coincidence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The first of a long series, I trust. Is this West-Pointer a permanent
      settler here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, for ever so long,&mdash;twenty years. He&rsquo;s a widower, but he has a
      daughter&mdash;&mdash; Oh, I know you&rsquo;ll fall in love with her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she like you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;ve never seen her, or General Trednoke either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come to think of it, though, nobody is like you, Grace. Now, will you be
      so good as to apologize again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think you&rsquo;re rather exacting, Harvey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      However, the apology was finally repeated, and continued, more or less,
      during the rest of the voyage; and Grace quite forgot that she had never
      made Harvey tell what was really the cause of his coming to California.
      But she, on her side, had a secret. She never allowed him to suspect that
      the past eighteen months of her life had been passed as employee in a New
      York dry-goods store.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III.
    </h2>
    <p>
      General Trednoke&rsquo;s house was built by Spanish missionaries in the
      sixteenth century; and in its main features it was little altered in three
      hundred years. In a climate where there is no frost, walls of adobe last
      as long as granite. The house consisted, practically, of but one story;
      for although there were rooms under the roof, they were used only for
      storage; no one slept in them. The plan of the building was not unlike
      that of a train of railway-cars,&mdash;or, it might be more appropriate to
      say, of emigrant-wagons. There was a series of rooms, ranged in a line,
      access to them being had from a narrow corridor, which opened on the rear
      veranda. Several of the rooms also communicated directly with each other,
      and, through low windows, gave on the veranda in front; for the house was
      merely a comparatively narrow array of apartments between two broad
      verandas, where most of the living, including much of the sleeping, was
      done.
    </p>
    <p>
      Logically, there can be nothing uglier than a Spanish-American dwelling of
      this type. But, as a matter of fact, they appear seductively beautiful.
      The thick white walls acquire a certain softness of tone; the surface
      scales off here and there, and cracks and crevices appear. In a damp
      country, like England, they would soon become covered with moss; but moss
      is not to be had in this region, though one were to offer for it the price
      of the silk velvet, triple ply, which so much resembles it. Nevertheless,
      there are compensations. The soil is inexhaustibly fertile, and its
      fertility expresses itself in the most inveterate beauty. Such colors and
      varieties of flowers exist nowhere else, and they continue all the year
      round. Climbing vines storm the walls, and toss their green ladders all
      over it, for beauty to walk up and down. Huge jars, standing on the
      verandas, emit volcanoes of lovely blossoms; and vases swung from the roof
      drip and overflow with others, as if water had turned to flowers. In the
      garden, which extends over several acres at the front of the house, and,
      as it were, makes it an island in a gorgeous sea of petals, there are
      roses, almonds, oranges, vines, pomegranates, and a hundred rivals whose
      names are unknown to the present historian, marching joyfully and
      triumphantly through the seasons, as the symphony moves through changes
      along its central theme.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything that is not an animal or a mineral seems to be a flower. There
      are too many flowers,&mdash;or, rather, there is not enough of anything
      else. The faculty of appreciation wearies, and at last ceases to take
      note. It is like conversing with a person whose every word is an epigram.
      The senses have their limitations, and imagination and expectation are
      half of beauty and delight, and the better half; otherwise we should have
      no souls. A single violet, discovered by chance in the by-ways of an April
      forest in New England, gives a pleasure as poignant as, and more spiritual
      than, the miles upon miles of Californian splendors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monotony is the ruling characteristic,&mdash;monotony of beauty, monotony
      of desolation, monotony even of variety. The glorious blue overhead is
      monotonous: as for the thermometer, it paces up and down within the
      narrowest limits, like a prisoner in his cell, or a meadow-lark hopping to
      and fro in a seven-inch cage. The plan and aspect of the buildings are
      monotonous, and so is the way of life of those who inhabit them.
      Fortunately, the sun does rise and set in Southern California: otherwise
      life there would be at an absolute stand-still, with no past and no
      future. But, as it is, one can look forward to morning, and remember the
      evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, there are the not infrequent but seldom very destructive
      earthquakes; the occasional cloud-bursts and tornadoes, sudden and violent
      as a gunpowder-explosion; and, finally, the astounding contrast between
      the fertile regions and the desert. There are places where you can stand
      with one foot planted in everlasting sterility and the other in immortal
      verdure. In the midst of an arid and hopeless waste, you come suddenly
      upon the brink of a narrow ravine, sharply defined as if cut out with an
      axe, and packed to the brim with enchanting and voluptuous fertility. Or
      you will come upon mountains which sweep upward out of burning death into
      sumptuous life. When the monotony of life meets the monotony of death,
      Southern California becomes a land of contrasts; and the contrasts
      themselves become monotonous.
    </p>
    <p>
      General Trednoke&rsquo;s ranch was very near the borders of these two mighty
      forces. An hour&rsquo;s easy ride would carry him to a region as barren and
      apparently as irreclaimable as that through which Childe Roland journeyed
      in quest of the Dark Tower; lying, too, in a temperature so fiery that it
      coagulated the blood in the veins, and stopped the beating of the heart.
      Underfoot were fine dust, and whitened bones; the air was prismatic and
      magical, ever conjuring up phantom pictures, whose characteristic was that
      they were at the farthest remove from any possible reality. The azure sky
      descended and became a lake; the pulsations of the atmosphere translated
      themselves into the rhythmic lapse of waves; spikes of sage-brush and
      blades of cactus became sylvan glades, and hamlets cheerful with
      inhabitants. Only, all was silent; and as you drew near, the scene
      trembled, altered, and was gone!
    </p>
    <p>
      Hideous black lizards and horned toads crawl and hop amid this desolation;
      and the deadly little sidewinder rattlesnake lies basking in the blaze of
      sunshine, which it distils into venom. Sometimes the level plain is broken
      up into savage ridges and awful canons, along whose arid bottoms no water
      streams. As you stagger through their chaotic bottoms, you see vast
      boulders poised overhead, tottering to a fall; a shiver of earthquake, a
      breath of hurricane, and they come crashing and splintering in destruction
      down. Along the sides of these acclivities extend long, level lines and
      furrows, marks of where the ocean flowed ages ago. But sometimes the hills
      are but accumulations of desert dust, which shift slowly from place to
      place under the action of the wind, melting away here to be re-erected
      yonder; mounding themselves, perhaps, above a living and struggling human
      being, to move forward, anon, leaving where he was a little heap of
      withered bones. A fearful place is this broad abyss, where once murmured
      the waters of a prehistoric sea. Let us return to the cool and fragrant
      security of the general&rsquo;s ranch.
    </p>
    <p>
      At right angles to the main body of the house extend two wings, thus
      forming three sides of a square, the interior of which is the court-yard.
      Here the business of the establishment is conducted. It is the liveliest
      spot on the premises; though it is liveliness of a very indolent sort. The
      veranda built around these sides is twenty feet in breadth, paved with
      tiles that have been worn into hollows by innumerable lazy footsteps,
      mostly shoeless, for this side of the house is frequented chiefly by the
      servants of the place, who are Mexican Indians. Ancient wooden settles are
      bolted to the walls; from hooks hang Indian baskets of bright colors; in
      one corner are stretched raw hides, which serve as beds. Small brown
      children, half naked, trot, clamber, and crawl about. Black-haired,
      swarthy women squat on the tiled floor, pursuing their vocations, or,
      often, doing nothing at all beyond continuing a placid organic existence.
      Boys and men saunter in and out of the court-yard, chatting or calling in
      their musical patois; once in a while there is a thud and clatter of
      hoofs, a rider arriving or departing. It is an entertaining scene,
      charming in its monotony of small changes and evolutions; you can sit
      watching it in a half-doze for twenty years at a stretch, and it may seem
      only as many minutes, or vice versa.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of the rooms in the wings are used for the kitchens and other
      servants&rsquo; quarters; but one large chamber is devoted to a special purpose
      of the general&rsquo;s own: it is a museum; the Curiosity-Room, he calls it. It
      is lighted by two windows opening on opposite sides, one on the
      court-yard, the other on an orange grove at the south end of the house.
      Besides being, in itself, a cool and pleasant spot, it is full of interest
      to any one who cares about the relics and antiquities of an ancient and
      vanishing race, concerning whom little is or ever will be known. There are
      two students in it at this moment; though whether they are studying
      antiquities is another matter. Let us give ear to their discourse and be
      instructed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this was made for you to wear, Miss Trednoke. Try it. It fits you
      perfectly, you see. There can be no doubt about your being a princess,
      now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I sometimes feel it,&mdash;here!&rdquo; she said, putting her hand on her
      bosom. She was looking at him as she said it, but her eyes, instead of any
      longer meeting his, seemed to turn their regard inward, and to traverse
      strange regions, not of this world. &ldquo;I see some one who is myself, though
      I can never have been she: she is surrounded with brightness, and people
      not like ours; she thinks of things that I have never known. It is the
      memory of a dream, I suppose,&rdquo; she added, in another tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heredity is a queer thing. You may be Aztecan over again, in mind and
      temperament; and every one knows how impressions are transmitted. If
      features and traits of character, why not particular thoughts and
      feelings?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it is better not to try to explain these things,&rdquo; said she, with
      the unconscious haughtiness which maidens acquire who have not seen the
      world and are adored by their family. &ldquo;They are great mysteries,&mdash;or
      else nothing.&rdquo; She now removed from her head the curious cap or helmet,
      ornamented with gold and with the green feathers of the humming-bird,
      which her companion had crowned her with, and hung it on its nail in the
      cabinet. &ldquo;Perhaps the thoughts came with the cap,&rdquo; she remarked, smiling
      slightly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel that way any more. I ought not to have spoken of
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope the time will come when you will feel that you may trust me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem easy to know, Mr. Freeman,&rdquo; she replied, looking at him
      contemplatively as she spoke, &ldquo;and yet you are not. There is one of you
      that thinks, and another that speaks. And you are not the same to my
      father, or to Professor Meschines, that you are to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the use of human beings except to take one out of one&rsquo;s self?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is not your real self that comes out,&rdquo; said Miriam, after a little
      pause. She never spoke hurriedly, or until after the coming speech had
      passed into her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Freeman laughed. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if I&rsquo;m a hypocrite, I&rsquo;m one of those
      who are made and not born. As a boy, I was frank enough. But a good part
      of my life has been spent with people who couldn&rsquo;t be trusted; and perhaps
      the habit of protecting myself against them has grown upon me. If I could
      only live here for a while it would be different.&mdash;Here&rsquo;s an
      odd-looking thing. What do you call that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We call it the Golden Fleece.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Golden Fleece! I can imagine a Medea; but where is the Dragon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Jason came, the Dragon might appear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember reading somewhere that the Dragon was less to be feared than
      Medea&rsquo;s eyes. But this fleece seems to have lost most of its gold. There
      is only a little gold embroidery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It shows where the gold is hidden.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s you that are concealing something now, Miss Trednoke. How can a
      woollen garment be a talisman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The secret might be woven into it, perhaps,&rdquo; replied Miriam, passing her
      fingers caressingly over the soft tunic. &ldquo;Then, when the right person puts
      it on, it would&mdash;&mdash;But you don&rsquo;t believe in these things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know: you don&rsquo;t give me a chance. But who is the right person?
      The thing seems rather small. I&rsquo;m sure I couldn&rsquo;t get it on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It can fit only the one it was made for,&rdquo; said Miriam, gravely. &ldquo;And if
      you wanted to find the gold, you would trust to your science, rather than
      to this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, gold-hunting is not in my line, at present. Every nugget has been
      paid for more than once, before it is found. Besides, there is something
      better than gold in Southern California,&mdash;something worth any labor
      to get.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked Miriam, turning her tranquil regard upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harvey Freeman had never been deficient in audacity. But, standing in the
      dark radiance of this maiden&rsquo;s eyes, his self-assurance dwindled, and he
      could not bring himself to say to her what he would have said to any other
      pretty woman he had ever met. For he felt that great pride and passion
      were concealed beneath that tranquil surface: it was a nature that might
      give everything to love, and would never pardon any frivolous parody
      thereof. Freeman had been acquainted with Miriam scarcely two days, but he
      had already begun to perceive the main indications of a character which a
      lifetime might not be long enough wholly to explore. Marriage had never
      been among the enterprises he had, in the course of his career, proposed
      to himself: he did not propose it now: yet he dared not risk the utterance
      of a word that would lead Miriam to look at him with an offended or
      contemptuous glance. It was not that she was, from the merely physical
      point of view, transcendently beautiful. His first impression of her,
      indeed, had been that she was merely an unusually good example of a type
      by no means rare in that region. But ere long he became sensible of a
      spiritual quality in her which lifted her to a level far above that which
      can be attained by mere harmony of features and proportions. Beneath the
      outward aspect lay a profound depth of being, glimpses of which were
      occasionally discernible through her eyes, in the tones of her voice, in
      her smile, in unconscious movements of her hands and limbs. Demonstrative
      she could never be; but she could, at will, feel with tropical intensity,
      and act with the swiftness and energy of a fanatic.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Miriam&rsquo;s company, Freeman forgot every one save her,&mdash;even
      himself,&mdash;though she certainly made no effort to attract him or
      (beyond the commonplaces of courtesy) to interest him. Consequently he had
      become entirely oblivious of the existence of such a person as Grace
      Parsloe, when, much to his irritation, he heard the voice of that young
      lady, mingled with others, approaching along the veranda. At the same
      moment he experienced acute regret at the whim of fortune which had made
      himself and that sprightly young lady fellow-passengers from Panama, and
      at the idle impulse which had prompted him to flirt with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the past was beyond remedy: it was his concern to deal with the
      present. In a few seconds, Grace entered the curiosity-room, followed by
      Professor Meschines, and by a dashing young Mexican senor, whom Freeman
      had met the previous evening, and who was called Don Miguel de Mendoza.
      The senor, to judge from his manner, had already fallen violently in love
      with Grace, and was almost dislocating his organs of speech in the effort
      to pay her romantic compliments in English. Freeman observed this with
      unalloyed satisfaction. But the look which Grace bent upon him and Miriam,
      on entering, and the ominous change which passed over her mobile
      countenance, went far to counteract this agreeable impression.
    </p>
    <p>
      One story is good until another is told. Freeman had really thought Grace
      a fascinating girl, until he saw Miriam. There was no harm in that: the
      trouble was, he had allowed Grace to perceive his admiration. He had
      already remarked that she was a creature of violent extremes, tempered,
      but not improved, by a thin polish of subtlety. She was now about to give
      an illustration of the passion of jealousy. But it was not her jealousy
      that Freeman minded: it was the prospect of Miriam&rsquo;s scorn when she should
      surmise that he had given Grace cause to be jealous. Miriam was not the
      sort of character to enter into a competition with any other woman about a
      lover. He would lose her before he had a chance to try to win her.
    </p>
    <p>
      But fortune proved rather more favorable than Freeman expected, or,
      perhaps, than he deserved. Grace&rsquo;s attack was too impetuous. She stopped
      just inside the threshold, and said, in an imperious tone, &ldquo;Come here, Mr.
      Freeman: I wish to speak to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he replied, resolving at once to widen the breach to the
      utmost extent possible, &ldquo;I am otherwise engaged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my word,&rdquo; observed the professor, with a chuckle, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re no
      diplomatist, Harvey! What are you two about here? Investigating
      antiquities?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The remains of ancient Mexico are more interesting than some of her
      recent products,&rdquo; returned Freeman, who wished to quarrel with somebody,
      and had promptly decided that Senor Don Miguel de Mendoza was the most
      available person. He bowed to the latter as he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&mdash;a&mdash;spoken to me?&rdquo; said the senor, stepping forward with a
      polite grimace. &ldquo;I no to quite comprehend&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray don&rsquo;t exert yourself to converse with me out of your own language,
      senor,&rdquo; interrupted Freeman, in Spanish. &ldquo;I was just remarking that the
      Spaniards seem to have degenerated greatly since they colonized Mexico.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Senor!&rdquo; exclaimed Don Miguel, stiffening and staring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; added Freeman, smiling benevolently upon him, &ldquo;I judge only
      from such specimens of the modern Mexican as I happen to meet with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Don Miguel&rsquo;s sallow countenance turned greenish white. But, before he
      could make a reply, Meschines, who scented mischief in the air, and
      divined that the gentler sex must somehow be at the bottom of it, struck
      in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may consider yourself lucky, Harvey, in making the acquaintance of a
      gentleman like Senor de Mendoza, who exemplifies the undimmed virtues of
      Cortez and Torquemada. For my part, I brought him here in the hope that he
      might be able to throw some light on the mystery of this embroidered
      garment, which I see you&rsquo;ve been examining. What do you say, Don Miguel?
      Have these designs any significance beyond mere ornament? Anything in the
      nature of hieroglyphics?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The senor was obliged to examine, and to enter into a discussion, though,
      of course, his ignorance of the subject in dispute was as the depths of
      that abyss which has no bottom. Miriam, who was not fond of Don Miguel,
      but who felt constrained to exceptional courtesy in view of Freeman&rsquo;s
      unwarrantable attack upon him, stood beside him and the Professor; and
      Freeman and Grace were thus left to fight it out with each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Grace had drawn her own conclusions from what had passed. Freeman had
      insulted Don Miguel. Wherefore? Obviously, it could only be because he
      thought that she was flirting with him. In other words, Freeman was
      jealous; and to be jealous is to love. Now, Grace was so constituted that,
      though she did not like to play second fiddle herself, yet she had no
      objection to monopolizing all the members of the male species who might
      happen, at a given moment, to be in sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had, consequently, already forgiven Freeman for his apparent
      unfaithfulness to her, by reason of his manifest jealousy of Don Miguel.
      As a matter of fact, he was not jealous, and he was unfaithful; but fate
      had decreed that there should be, for the moment, a game of
      cross-purposes; and the decrees of fate are incorrigible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had no idea you were so savage,&rdquo; she said, softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not savage,&rdquo; replied Freeman. &ldquo;I am bored.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know as I can blame you,&rdquo; said Grace, still more softly:
      she fancied he was referring to Miriam. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t much like Spanish
      mixtures myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One has to take what one can get,&rdquo; said Freeman, referring to Don Miguel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s all right now,&rdquo; rejoined she, meaning that Freeman and herself
      were reconciled after their quarrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you are satisfied, I am,&rdquo; observed Freeman, too indifferent to care
      what she meant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only, you mustn&rsquo;t take that poor young man too seriously,&rdquo; she went on:
      &ldquo;these Mexicans are absurdly demonstrative, but they don&rsquo;t mean anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t, if he values his skin,&rdquo; said Freeman, meaning that if Don
      Miguel attempted to interfere between himself and Miriam he would wring
      his neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t, I promise you,&rdquo; said Grace, sparkling with pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite see how you can help it,&rdquo; returned Freeman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should hope I could manage a creature like that!&rdquo; murmured she,
      smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Freeman, after a pause,&mdash;for Grace&rsquo;s seeming change of
      attitude puzzled him a little,&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you look at it that way. I
      don&rsquo;t wish to be meddled with; that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shan&rsquo;t be,&rdquo; she whispered; and then, just when they were approaching
      the point where their eyes might have been opened, in came General
      Trednoke. The group round the Golden Fleece broke up.
    </p>
    <p>
      The general wore his riding-dress, and his bearing was animated, though he
      was covered with dust.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was wondering what had become of you all,&rdquo; he said, as the others
      gathered about him. &ldquo;I have been taking a canter to the eastward.
      Kamaiakan said this morning that one of the boys had brought news of a
      cloud-burst in that direction. I rode far enough to ascertain that there
      has really been something of the kind, and I think it has affected the
      arroyo on the farther side of the little sierra. Now, I don&rsquo;t know how you
      gentlemen feel, but it occurred to me that it might be interesting to make
      up a little party of exploration to-morrow. Would you like to try it,
      Meschines?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure I should!&rdquo; the professor replied. &ldquo;I imagine I can stand as
      much of the desert as you can! And I want to catch a sidewinder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good! And you, Mr. Freeman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would suit me exactly,&rdquo; said the latter. &ldquo;In fact, I had been
      intending to gratify my curiosity by making some such expedition on my own
      account.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said the general, eying him with some intentness. &ldquo;Well, we may be
      able to show you something more curious than you anticipate.&mdash;And
      now, Senor de Mendoza, there is only you left. May we count on your
      company into the desert?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the Mexican, with a bow and a grimace, excused himself. Scientific
      curiosity was an unknown emotion to him; but he foresaw an opportunity to
      have Grace all to himself, and he meant to improve it. He also wished
      leisure to think over some plan for getting rid of Senor Freeman, in whom
      he scented a rival, and who, whether a rival or not, had behaved to him
      with a lack of consideration in the presence of ladies.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      General Trednoke&rsquo;s household went early to bed. As there was more
      accommodation in the old house than sufficed for its present inhabitants,
      it followed that each of them had a regal allowance of rooms. And when
      Grace Parsloe became one of the occupants, she was allotted two commodious
      apartments at the extremity of the left wing. They communicated, through
      long windows, with the veranda in front, and by means of doors with the
      passage, or hall, traversing the house from end to end. If, therefore, she
      happened to be sleepless, she might issue forth into the garden, and
      wander about there without let or hinderance until she was ready to accept
      the wooing of the god of dreams; or, if supernatural terrors daunted her,
      she could in a few seconds transfer herself and her fears to Miriam&rsquo;s
      chamber, which occupied the same position in the right wing that hers did
      in the left.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night, as is customary in that climate, where the atmosphere is pure
      and evaporation rapid, was cool and still. By ten o&rsquo;clock there was no
      sound to indicate that any person was awake; though, to an acute ear, the
      rise and fall of regular breathing, or even an occasional snore, might
      have given evidence of slumber. At the back of the house, the Indian
      retainers were lapped in silence. They were a harmless people,&mdash;somewhat
      disposed, perhaps, to small pilferings, in an amiable and loyal way, but
      incapable of anything seriously criminal. There were no locks on the
      doors, and most of them stood ajar. Tramps and burglars were unknown.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miriam, having put on her night-dress, stood a few minutes at her window,
      gazing out on the soft darkness of the garden. All there was peacefulness
      and fragrance. The leaves of the plants hung motionless; the blossoms
      seemed to hush themselves to the enjoyment of their own sweetness. The sky
      was clear, but there was no moon. A beautiful planet, however, bright
      enough to cast a shadow, hung in the southwestern sky, and its mysterious
      light touched Miriam&rsquo;s face, and cast a dim rectangle of radiance on the
      white matting that carpeted the floor of her room. It was the planet
      Venus,&mdash;the star of love. Miriam thought it would be a pleasant place
      to live in. But one need not journey to Venus to find a world where love
      is the ruling passion. Circumstances over which she has no control may
      cause such a world to come into existence in a girl&rsquo;s heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      She left the window at last, and got into bed, where she soon presented an
      image of perfect repose. Meanwhile, in a dark corner of the court-yard at
      the rear, a dark, pyramidal object abode without motion. It might have
      been taken for a heap of blankets piled up there. But if you examined it
      more narrowly you would have detected in it the vague outlines of a human
      figure, squatting on its haunches, with its head resting on its knees, and
      its arms clasped round them,&mdash;somewhat as figures sit in Egyptian
      hieroglyphics, or like Aztecan mummies in the tomb. So still was it, it
      might itself have been a mummy. But ever and anon a blinking of the narrow
      eyes in the bronze countenance told that it was no mummy, but a living
      creature. In fact, it was none other than the aged and austere Kamaiakan,
      who, for reasons best known to himself, chose to spend the hours usually
      devoted to rest in an attitude that no European or white American could
      have maintained with comfort longer than five minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour&mdash;two hours&mdash;passed away. Then Kamaiakan noiselessly
      arose, peered about him cautiously for a few moments, and passed out of
      the court-yard through the open gate. He turned to the left, and, stealing
      beneath Miriam&rsquo;s windows, paused there for an instant and made certain
      gestures with his arms. Anon he continued his way to the garden, and was
      soon concealed by the thick shrubbery.
    </p>
    <p>
      History requires us to follow him. The garden extended westward, and was
      quite a spacious enclosure: one not familiar with its winding paths might
      easily lose himself there on a dark night. But Kamaiakan knew where he was
      going, and the way thither. He now stalked along more swiftly, taking one
      turn after another, brushing aside the low-hanging boughs, and passing the
      loveliest flowers without a glance. He was as one preoccupied with
      momentous business. Presently he arrived at a small open space, remote and
      secluded. It was completely surrounded by tall shrubbery. In the centre
      was a basin of stone, evidently very ancient, filled to the brim with the
      clear water of a spring, which bubbled up from the bottom, and,
      overflowing by way of a gap in the edge, became a small rivulet, which
      stole away in the direction of the sea. Across the slightly undulating
      surface of the basin trembled the radiance of the star.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kamaiakan knelt down beside it, and, bending over, gazed intently into the
      water. Presently he dipped his hands in it, and sprinkled shining drops
      over his own gaunt person, and over the ground in the vicinity of the
      spring. He made strange movements with his arms, bowed his head and
      erected it again, and traced curious figures on the ground with his
      finger. It appeared as if the venerable Indian had solemnly lost his
      senses and had sought out this lonely spot to indulge the vagaries of his
      insanity. If so, his silence and deliberation afforded an example worthy
      of consideration by other lunatics.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he ceased his performance, and held himself in a listening
      attitude. A light, measured sound was audible, accompanied by the rustling
      of leaves. It came nearer. There was a glimpse of whiteness through the
      interstices of the surrounding foliage, and then a slender figure, clad in
      close-fitting raiment, entered the little circle. It wore a sort of tunic,
      reaching half-way to the knees, and leggings of the same soft,
      grayish-white material. The head was covered with a sort of hood, which
      left only the face exposed; and this too might be covered by a species of
      veil or mask, which, however, was now fastened back on the headpiece,
      after the manner of a visor. The front of the tunic was embroidered with
      fantastic devices in gold thread, brightened here and there with precious
      stones; and other devices appeared on the hood. The face of this figure
      was pale and calm, with great dark eyes beneath black brows. The stature
      was no greater than that of a lad of fifteen, but the bearing was composed
      and dignified. The contours of the figure, however, even as seen by that
      dim light, were those of neither a boy nor a man. The wearer of the tunic
      was a girl, just rounding into womanhood, and the face was the face of
      Miriam.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet it was not by this name that Kamaiakan addressed her. After making a
      deep obeisance, touching his hand to her foot and then to his own forehead
      and breast, he said, in a language that was neither Spanish nor such as
      the modern Indians of Mexico use,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Welcome, Semitzin! May this night be the beginning of high things!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am ready,&rdquo; replied the other, in a soft and low voice, but with a
      certain stateliness of utterance unlike the usual manner of General
      Trednoke&rsquo;s daughter: &ldquo;I was glad to hear you call, and to see again the
      stars and the earth. Have you anything to tell?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are events which may turn to our harm, most revered princess. The
      master of this house&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you not call him my father, Kamaiakan?&rdquo; interposed the other. &ldquo;He
      is indeed the father of this mortal body which I wear, which (as you tell
      me) bears the name of Miriam. Besides, are not Miriam and I united by the
      thread of descent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something of the spirit that is you dwells in her also,&rdquo; said the Indian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And does she know of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At times, my princess; but only as one remembers a dream.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I might converse with her and instruct her in the truth,&rdquo; said the
      princess. &ldquo;And she, in turn, might speak to me of things that perplex me.
      I live and move in this mortal world, and yet (you tell me) three
      centuries have passed since what is called my death. To me it seems as if
      I had but slept through a night, and were awake again. Nor can I tell what
      has happened&mdash;what my life and thoughts have been&mdash;during this
      long lapse of time. Yet it must be that I live another life: I cannot rest
      in extinction. Three times you have called me forth; yet whence I come
      hither, or whither I return, is unknown to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a memory of the spirit,&rdquo; replied Kamaiakan, &ldquo;and a memory of the
      body. They are separate, and cannot communicate with each other. Such is
      the law.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet I remember, as if it were yesterday, the things that were done when
      Montezuma was king. And well do I remember you, Kamaiakan!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true I live again, princess, though not in the flesh and bones that
      died with you in the past. But in the old days I was acquainted with
      mysteries, and learned the secrets of the world of spirits; and this
      science still remained with me after the change, so that I was able to
      know that I was I, and that you could be recalled to speak with me through
      the tongue of Miriam. But there are some things that I do not know; and it
      is for that I have been bold to summon you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can I tell you that can be of use to you in this present life,
      Kamaiakan, when all whom we knew and loved are gone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To you only, Semitzin, is known the place of concealment of the treasure
      which, in the old times, you and I hid in the desert. I indeed remember
      the event, and somewhat of the region of the hiding; but I cannot put my
      hand upon the very spot. I have tried to discover it; but when I approach
      it my mind becomes confused between the present and the past, and I am
      lost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember it well,&rdquo; said Semitzin. &ldquo;We rode across the desert, carrying
      the treasure on mules. The air was still, and the heat very heavy. The
      desert descended in a great hollow: you told me it was where, in former
      days, the ocean had been. At last there were rocky hills before us; we
      rode towards a great rock shaped like the pyramid on which the sacrifices
      were held in Tenochtitlan. We passed round its base, and entered a deep
      and narrow valley, that seemed to have been ploughed out of the heart of
      the earth and to descend into it. Then&mdash;&mdash; But what is it you
      wish to do with this treasure, Kamaiakan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It belongs to your race, princess, and was hidden that the murderers of
      Montezuma might not seize it. I was bound by an oath, after the peril was
      past, to restore it to the rightful owners. But our country remained under
      the rule of the conquerors; and my life went out. But now the conquerors
      have been conquered in their turn, and Miriam is the last inheritor of
      your blood. When I have delivered to her this trust, my work will be done,
      and I can return to the world which you inhabit. The time is come; and
      only by your help can the restitution be made.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was there, then, a time fixed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The stars tell me so. And other events make it certain that there must be
      no delay. The general has it in mind to discover the gates through which
      the waters under-ground may arise and again form the sea which flowed
      hereabouts in the ancient times. Now, this sea will fill the ravine in
      which the treasure lies, and make it forever unattainable. A youth has
      also come here who is skilled in the sciences, and whom the general will
      ask to help him in the thing he is to attempt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is this youth?&rdquo; asked Semitzin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is of the new people who inherit this land: his name is Freeman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is something in me&mdash;I know not what&mdash;that seems to tell
      me I have been near such a one. Can it be so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The other self, who now sleeps, knows of him,&rdquo; replied the ancient
      Indian. &ldquo;He is a well-looking youth, and I think he has a desire towards
      her we call Miriam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And does she love him?&rdquo; inquired the princess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A maiden&rsquo;s heart is a riddle, even to herself,&rdquo; said Kamaiakan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there is a sympathy that makes me feel her heart in my own,&rdquo; rejoined
      Semitzin. &ldquo;Love is a thing that pierces through time, and through barriers
      which separate the mind and memory of the past from the present. I&mdash;as
      you know, Kamaiakan&mdash;was never wedded; the fate of our people, and my
      early end, kept that from me. But the thought of that youth is here,&rdquo;&mdash;she
      put her hand on her bosom,&mdash;&ldquo;and it seems to me that, were we to
      meet, I should know him. Perhaps, were that to be, Miriam and I might thus
      come to be aware of each other, and live henceforth one life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such matters are beyond my knowledge,&rdquo; said the Indian, shaking his head.
      &ldquo;The gods know what will be. It is for us, now, to regain the treasure.
      Are you willing, my princess, to accompany me thither?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am ready. Shall it be now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not now, but soon. I will call you when the moment comes. The place is
      but a ride of two or three hours from here. None must know of our
      departure, for there are some here whom I do not trust. We must go by
      night. You will wear the garments you now have on, without which all might
      miscarry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can the garments affect the result, Kamaiakan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A powerful spell is laid upon them, princess. Moreover, the characters
      wrought upon them, with gold thread and jewels, are mystical, and the
      substance of the garment itself has a virtue to preserve the wearer from
      evil. It is the same that was worn by you when the treasure was hidden;
      and it may be, Semitzin, that without its magic aid your spirit could not
      know itself in this world as now it can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke the last words, a low sound, wandering and muttering with an
      inward note, came palpitating on their ears through the night air. It
      seemed to approach from no direction that could be identified, yet it was
      at first remote, and then came nearer, and in a moment trembled around
      them, and shivered in the solid earth beneath their feet; and in another
      instant it had passed on, and was subdued slowly into silence in the
      shadowy distance. No one who has once heard that sound can mistake it for
      any other, or ever can forget it. The air had suddenly become close and
      tense; and now a long breeze swept like a sigh through the garden, dying
      away in a long-drawn wail; and out of the west came a hollow murmur, like
      that of a mighty wave breaking upon the shore of the ocean.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The earthquake!&rdquo; whispered Kamaiakan, rising to his feet. And then he
      pointed to the stone basin. &ldquo;Look! the spring!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is gone!&rdquo; exclaimed Semitzin.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, in truth, the water, with a strange, sucking noise, disappeared
      through the bottom of the basin, leaving the glistening cavity which had
      held it, green with slimy water-weed, empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The time is near, indeed!&rdquo; muttered the Indian. &ldquo;The second shock may
      cause the waters from which this spring came to rise as no living man has
      seen them rise, and make the sea return, and the treasure be lost. In a
      few days all may be over. But you, princess, must vanish: though the shock
      was but slight, some one might be awakened; and were you to be discovered,
      our plans might go wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Must I depart so soon?&rdquo; said Semitzin, regretfully. &ldquo;The earth is
      beautiful, Kamaiakan: the smell of the flowers is sweet, and the stars in
      the sky are bright. To feel myself alive, to breathe, to walk, to see, are
      sweet. Perhaps I have no other conscious life than this. I would like to
      remain as I am: I would like to see the sun shine, and to hear the birds
      sing, and to see the men and women who live in this age. Is there no way
      of keeping me here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot tell; it may be,&mdash;but it must not be now, Semitzin,&rdquo; the
      old man replied, with a troubled look. &ldquo;The ways of the gods are not our
      ways. She whose body you inhabit&mdash;she has her life to live.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But is that girl more worthy to live than I? You have called me into
      being again: you have made me know how pleasant this world is. Miriam
      sleeps: she need never know; she need never awake again. You were faithful
      to me in the old time: have you more care for her than for me? I feel all
      the power and thirst of youth in me: the gods did not let me live out my
      life: may they not intend that I shall take it up again now? Besides, I
      wear Miriam&rsquo;s body: could I not seem to others to be Miriam indeed? How
      could they guess the truth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will think of what you say, princess,&rdquo; said Kamaiakan. &ldquo;Something may
      perhaps be done; but it must be done gradually: you would need much
      instruction in the ways of the new world before you could safely enter
      into its life. Leave that to me. I am loyal as ever: is it not to fulfil
      the oath made to you that I am here? and what would Miriam be to me, were
      she not your inheritor? Be satisfied for the present: in a few days we
      will meet and speak again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The power is yours, Kamaiakan: it is well to argue, when with a word you
      can banish me forever! Yet what if I were to say that, unless you consent
      to the thing I desire, I will not show you where the treasure lies?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Princess Semitzin!&rdquo; exclaimed the Indian, &ldquo;remember that it is not
      against me, but against the gods, that you would contend. The gods know
      that I have no care for treasure. But they will not forgive a broken oath;
      and they will not hold that one guiltless through whom it is brought to
      naught?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we shall meet again,&rdquo; answered Semitzin, after a pause. &ldquo;But do you
      remember that you, too, are not free from responsibility in this matter.
      You have called me back: see to it that you do me justice.&rdquo; She waved her
      hands with a gesture of adieu, turned, and left the enclosure. Kamaiakan
      sank down again beside the empty bowl of the fountain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Semitzin returned along the path by which she had come, towards the house.
      As she turned round one of the corners, she saw a man&rsquo;s figure before her,
      strolling slowly along in the same direction in which she was going. In a
      few moments he heard her light footfall, and, facing about, confronted
      her. She continued to advance until she was within arm&rsquo;s reach of him:
      then she paused, and gazed steadfastly in his face. He was the first human
      being, save Kamaiakan, that she had seen since her eyes closed upon the
      world of Tenochtitlan, three hundred years before.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man looked upon her with manifest surprise. It was too dark to
      distinguish anything clearly, but it did not take him long to surmise that
      the figure was that of a woman, and her countenance, though changed in
      aspect by the head-dress she were, yet had features which, he knew, he had
      seen before. But could it be Miriam Trednoke who was abroad at such an
      hour and in such a costume? He did not recognize the Golden Fleece, but it
      was evident enough that she was clad as women are not.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before he could think of anything to say to her, she smiled, and uttered
      some words in a soft, flowing language with which he was entirely
      unacquainted. The next moment she had glided past him, and was out of
      sight round the curve of the path, leaving him in a state of perplexity
      not altogether gratifying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the deuce can it mean?&rdquo; he muttered to himself. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t be mistaken
      about its being Miriam. And yet she didn&rsquo;t look at me as if she recognized
      me. What can she be doing out here at midnight? I suppose it&rsquo;s none of my
      business: in fact, she might very reasonably ask the same question of me.
      And if I were to tell her that I had only ridden over to spend a
      sentimental hour beneath her window, what would she say? If she answered
      in the same lingo she used just now, I should be as wise as before. After
      all, it may have been somebody else. The image in my mind projected itself
      on her countenance. I certainly must be in love! I almost wish I&rsquo;d never
      come here. This complication about the general&rsquo;s irrigating scheme makes
      it awkward. I&rsquo;m bound not to explain things to him; and yet, if I don&rsquo;t,
      and he discovers (as he can&rsquo;t help doing) what I am here for, nothing will
      persuade him that I haven&rsquo;t been playing a double game; and that would not
      be a promising preliminary towards becoming a member of his family. If
      Miriam were only Grace, now, it would be plain sailing. Hello! who&rsquo;s this?
      Senor Don Miguel, as I&rsquo;m a sinner! What is he up to, pray? Can this be the
      explanation of Miriam&rsquo;s escapade? I have a strong desire to blow a hole
      through that fellow!&mdash;Buenas noches, Senor de Mendoza! I am enchanted
      to have the unexpected honor of meeting you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Senor de Mendoza turned round, disagreeably startled. It is only fair to
      explain that he had not come hither with any lover-like designs towards
      Miriam. Grace was the magnet that had drawn his steps to the Trednokes&rsquo; 
      garden, and the truth is that that enterprising young lady was not without
      a suspicion that he might turn up. Could this information have been
      imparted to Freeman, it would have saved much trouble; but, as it was, not
      only did he jump to the conclusion that Don Miguel was his rival (and,
      seemingly, a not unsuccessful one), but a similar misgiving as to
      Freeman&rsquo;s purposes towards Grace found its way into the heart of the
      Spaniard. It was a most perverse trick of fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two men contemplated each other, each after his own fashion: Don
      Miguel pale, glaring, bristling; Freeman smiling, insolent, hectoring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why are you here, senor?&rdquo; demanded the former, at length.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Partly, senor, because such is my pleasure. Partly, to inform you that
      your presence here offends me, and to humbly request you to be off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Senor, this is an impertinence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Senor, one is not impertinent to prowling greasers. One admonishes them,
      and, if they do not obey, one chastises them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you talk of chastising Don Miguel de Mendoza? Senor, I will wash out
      that insult with your blood!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excellent! It is at your service for the taking. But, lest we disturb the
      repose of our friends yonder, let us seek a more convenient spot. I
      noticed a very pretty little glade on the right as I rode over here. You
      are armed? Good! we will have this little affair adjusted within half an
      hour. Yonder star&mdash;the planet of love, senor&mdash;shall see fair
      play. Andamos!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Having mounted their steeds, the two sanguinary young gentlemen rode
      onwards, side by side, but in silence; for the souls of those who have
      resolved to slay each other find small delight in vain conversation.
      Moreover, there is that in the conscious proximity of death which
      stimulates to thought much more than to speech. But Freeman preserved an
      outward demeanor of complacent calm, as one who doubts not, nor dreads,
      the issue; and, indeed, this was not the first time by many that he had
      taken his life in his hand and brought it unscathed through dangers. Don
      Miguel, on the other hand, was troubled in spirit, and uneasy in the
      flesh. He was one soon hot and soon cold; and this long ride to the
      decisive event went much against his stomach. If the conflict had taken
      place there in the garden, while the fire of the insult was yet scorching
      him, he could have fought it out with good will; but now the night air
      seemed chiller and chiller, and its frigidity crept into his nerves: he
      doubted of the steadiness of his aim, bethought himself that the darkness
      was detrimental to accurate shooting, and wondered whether Senor Freeman
      would think it necessary to fight across a handkerchief. He could not help
      regretting, too, that the quarrel had not been occasioned by some more
      definite and satisfactory provocation,&mdash;something which merely to
      think of would steel the heart to irrevocable murderousness. But no blow
      had passed; even the words, though bitter to swallow, had been wrapt in
      the phrases of courtesy; and perhaps the whole affair was the result of
      some misapprehension. He stole a look at the face of his companion; and
      the latter&rsquo;s air of confident and cheerful serenity made him feel worse
      than ever. Was he being brought out here to be butchered for nothing,&mdash;he,
      Don Miguel de Mendoza, who had looked forward to many pleasures in this
      life? It was too bad. It was true, the fortune of war might turn the other
      way; but Don Miguel was aware of a sensation in his bones which made this
      hope weak.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length Freeman drew rein and glanced around him. They were in a lonely
      and&mdash;Don Miguel thought&mdash;a most desolate and unattractive spot.
      An open space of about half an acre was bounded on one side by a growth of
      wild mustard, whose slender stalks rose to more than the height of a man&rsquo;s
      head. On the other side was a grove of live-oak; and in front, the ground
      fell away in a rugged, bush-grown declivity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It strikes me that this is just about what we want,&rdquo; remarked Freeman, in
      his full, cheerful tones. &ldquo;We are half a mile from the road; the ground is
      fairly level; and there&rsquo;s no possibility of our being disturbed. I was
      thinking, this afternoon, as I passed through here, what an ideal spot it
      was for just such a little affair as you and I are bent on. But I didn&rsquo;t
      venture to anticipate such speedy good fortune as your obliging
      condescension has brought to pass, Don Miguel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Caramba!&rdquo; muttered the senor, shivering. He might have said more, but was
      unwilling to trust his voice, or to waste nervous energy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, Freeman had dismounted, and was tethering his horse. It
      occurred to the senor that it would be easy to pull his gun, send a bullet
      through his companion, and gallop away. He did not yield to this
      temptation, partly from traditional feeling that it would not be suitable
      conduct for a De Mendoza, partly because he might miss the shot or only
      inflict a wound, and partly because such deeds demand a nerve which, at
      that moment, was not altogether at his command. Instead, he slowly
      dismounted himself, and wondered whether it would ever be vouchsafed him
      to sit in that saddle again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Freeman now produced his revolver, a handsome, silver-mounted weapon, that
      looked business-like. &ldquo;What sort of a machine is yours?&rdquo; he inquired,
      pleasantly. &ldquo;You can take your choice. I&rsquo;m not particular, but I can
      recommend this as a sure thing, if you would like to try it. It never
      misses at twenty paces.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty paces?&rdquo; repeated Don Miguel, with a faint gleam of hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course we won&rsquo;t have any twenty paces to-night,&rdquo; added Freeman, with a
      laugh. &ldquo;I thought it might be a good plan to start at, say, fifteen, and
      advance firing. In that way, one or other of us will be certain to do
      something sooner or later. Would that arrangement be agreeable to Senor de
      Mendoza?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Valga me Dios! I am content,&rdquo; said the latter, fetching a deep breath,
      and setting his teeth. &ldquo;I will keep my weapon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Muy buen,&rdquo; returned the American. &ldquo;So now let us take our ground: that
      is, if you are quite ready?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly they selected their stations, facing respectively about north
      and south, with the planet of love between them, as it were. &ldquo;Oblige me by
      giving the word, senor,&rdquo; said Freeman, cocking his weapon.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Don Miguel was staring with perturbed visage at something behind his
      antagonist. &ldquo;Santa Maria!&rdquo; he faltered, &ldquo;what is yonder? It is a spirit!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Freeman had his wits about him, and perhaps entertained a not too high
      opinion of Mexican fair play. So, before turning round, he advanced till
      he was alongside his companion. Then he looked, and saw something which
      was certainly enigmatic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the wild-mustard plants there appeared a moving luminosity, having
      an irregular, dancing motion, as of a will-o&rsquo;-the-wisp singularly
      agitated. Sometimes it uplifted itself on high, then plunged downwards,
      and again jerked itself from side to side; occasionally it would quite
      vanish for an instant. Accompanying this manifestation there was a clawing
      and reaching of shadowy arms: altogether, it was as if some titanic
      spectral grasshopper, with a heart of fire, were writhing and kicking in
      convulsions of phantom agony. Such an apparition, in an hour and a place
      so lonely, might stagger a less superstitious soul than that of Don Miguel
      de Mendoza.
    </p>
    <p>
      Freeman gazed at it for a moment in silence. It mystified him, and then
      irritated him. When one is bent heart and soul upon an important
      enterprise, any interruption is an annoyance. Perhaps there was in the
      young American&rsquo;s nature just enough remains of belief in witches and
      hobgoblins to make him feel warranted in resorting to extreme measures. At
      any rate, he lifted his revolver, and fired.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a long shot for a revolver: nevertheless it took effect. The
      luminous object disappeared with a faint explosive sound, followed by a
      shout unmistakably human. The long stems of the wild mustard swayed and
      parted, and out sprang a figure, which ran straight towards the two young
      men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hereupon, Don Miguel, hissing out an appeal to the Virgin and the saints,
      turned and fled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, the mysterious figure continued its onward career; and Freeman
      once more levelled his weapon,&mdash;when a voice, which gave him such a
      start of surprise as well-nigh caused him to pull the trigger for sheer
      lack of self-command, called out, &ldquo;Why, you abominable young villain! What
      the mischief do you mean? Do you want to be hanged?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Professor Meschines!&rdquo; faltered Freeman.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was indeed that worthy personage, and he was on fire with wrath. He
      held in one hand a shattered lantern mounted on the end of a pole, and in
      the other a long-handled net of gauze, such as entomologists use to catch
      moths withal. Under his left arm was slung a brown japanned case, in which
      he presumably deposited the spoils of his skill. Freeman&rsquo;s shot had not
      only smashed and extinguished the lantern which served as bait for the
      game, but had also given the professor a disagreeable reminder that the
      tenure of human life is as precarious as that of the silly moth which
      allows itself to be lured to destruction by shining promises of bliss.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my soul, professor, I am very sorry,&rdquo; said Freeman. &ldquo;You have no
      idea how formidable you looked; and you could hardly expect me to imagine
      that you would be abroad at such an hour&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why not, I should like to know?&rdquo; shouted the professor, towering with
      indignation. &ldquo;Was I doing anything to be ashamed of? And what are you
      doing here, pray, with loaded revolvers in your hands?&mdash;Hallo! who&rsquo;s
      this?&rdquo; he exclaimed, as Don Miguel advanced doubtfully out of the gloom.
      &ldquo;Senor de Mendoza, as I&rsquo;m a sinner! and armed, too! Well, really! Are you
      two out on a murdering expedition?&mdash;Oho!&rdquo; he went on, in a changed
      tone, glancing keenly from one to another: &ldquo;methinks I see the bottom of
      this mystery. You have ridden forth, like the champions of romance, to do
      doughty deeds upon each other!&mdash;Is it not so, Don Miguel?&rdquo; he
      demanded, turning his fierce spectacles suddenly on that young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don Miguel, ignoring a secret gesture from Freeman, admitted that he had
      been on the point of expunging the latter from this mortal sphere.
    </p>
    <p>
      The professor chuckled sarcastically. &ldquo;I see! Blood! Wounded honor! The
      code!&mdash;But, by the way, I don&rsquo;t see your seconds! Where are your
      seconds?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear sir,&rdquo; said Freeman, &ldquo;I assure you it&rsquo;s all a mistake. We just
      happened to meet at the gen&mdash;er&mdash;happened to meet, and were
      riding home together&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, listen to me, Harvey,&rdquo; the professor interrupted, holding up an
      expository finger. &ldquo;You have known me since some ten years, I think; and I
      have known you. You were a clever boy in your studies; but it was your
      foible to fancy yourself cleverer than you were. Acting under that
      delusion, you pitted yourself against me on one or two occasions; and I
      leave it to your candid recollection whether you or I had the best of the
      encounter. You call yourself a man, now; but I make bold to say that the&mdash;discrepancy,
      let us call it&mdash;between you and me remains as conspicuous as ever it
      was. I see through you, sir, much more clearly than, by this light, I can
      see you. I am fond of you, Harvey; but I feel nothing but contempt for
      your present attitude. In the first place, conscious as you are of your
      skill with that weapon, you know that this affair&mdash;even had seconds
      been present&mdash;would have been, not a duel, but an assassination. You
      acted like a coward!&mdash;I say it, sir, like a coward!&mdash;and I hope
      you may live to be as much ashamed of yourself as I am now ashamed for
      you. Secondly, your conduct, considered in its relations to&mdash;to
      certain persons whom I will not name, is that of a boor and a blackguard.
      Suppose you had accomplished the cowardly murder&mdash;the cowardly
      murder, I said, sir&mdash;that you were bent upon to-night. Do you think
      that would be a grateful and acceptable return for the courtesy and
      confidence that have been shown you in that house?&mdash;a house, sir, to
      which I myself introduced you, under the mistaken belief that you were a
      gentleman, or, at least, could feign gentlemanly behavior! But I won&rsquo;t&mdash;my
      feelings won&rsquo;t allow me to enlarge further upon this point. But allow me
      to add, in the third place, that you have shown yourself a purblind
      donkey. Actually, you haven&rsquo;t sense enough to know the difference between
      those who pull with you and those who pull against you. Now, I happen to
      know&mdash;to know, do you hear?&mdash;that had you succeeded in what you
      were just about to attempt, you would have removed your surest ally,&mdash;the
      surest, because his interests prompt him to favor yours. You pick out the
      one man who was doing his best to clear the obstacle out of your path, and
      what do you do?&mdash;Thank him?&mdash;Not you! You plot to kill him! But
      even had he been, as you in your stupidity imagined, your rival, do you
      think the course you adopted would have promoted your advantage? Let me
      tell you, sir, that you don&rsquo;t know the kind of people you are dealing
      with. You would never have been permitted to cross their threshold again.
      And you may take my word for it, if ever you venture to recur to any such
      folly, I will see to it that you receive your deserts.&mdash;Well, I think
      we understand each other, now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Freeman&rsquo;s emotions had undergone several variations during the course of
      the mighty professor&rsquo;s harangue. But he had ended by admitting the force
      of the argument; and the reminiscences of college lecturings aroused by
      the incident had tickled his sense of humor and quenched his anger. He
      looked at the professor with a sparkle of laughter in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have done very wrong, sir,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m very sorry for it. If you
      won&rsquo;t give me any bad marks this time, I&rsquo;ll promise to be good in future.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! very smooth! To begin with, suppose you ask pardon of Senor Don
      Miguel de Mendoza for the affront you have put upon him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To a soul really fearless, even an apology has no terrors. Moreover,
      Freeman&rsquo;s night ride with Don Miguel, though brief in time, had sufficed
      to give him the measure of the Mexican&rsquo;s character; and he respected it so
      little that he could no longer take the man seriously, or be sincerely
      angry with him. The professor&rsquo;s assurance as to Don Miguel&rsquo;s
      inoffensiveness had also its weight; and it was therefore with a quite
      royal gesture of amicable condescension that Freeman turned upon his late
      antagonist and held out his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Senor Don Miguel de Mendoza,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I humbly tender you my apologies
      and crave your pardon. My conduct has been inexcusable; I beg you to
      excuse it. I deserve your reprobation; I entreat the favor of your
      friendship. Senor, between men of honor, a misunderstanding is a
      misunderstanding, and an apology is an apology. I lament the existence of
      the first; the professor, here, is witness that I lay the second at your
      feet. May I hope to receive your hand as a pledge that you restore me to
      the privilege of your good will?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now, Don Miguel&rsquo;s soul had been grievously exercised that night: he had
      been insulted, he had shivered beneath the shadow of death, he had been a
      prey to superstitious terrors, and he had been utterly perplexed by the
      professor&rsquo;s eloquent address, whereof (as it was delivered in good
      American, and with a rapidity of utterance born of strong feeling) he had
      comprehended not a word, and the unexpected effect of which upon his late
      adversary he was at a loss to understand. Although, therefore, he had no
      stomach for battle, he was oppressed by a misgiving lest the whole
      transaction had been in some way planned to expose him to ridicule; and
      for this reason he was disposed to treat Freeman&rsquo;s peaceful overtures with
      suspicion. His heart did not respond to those overtures, but neither was
      it stout enough to enable him to reject them explicitly. Accordingly, he
      adopted that middle course which, in spite of the proverb, is not seldom
      the least expedient. He disregarded the proffered hand, bowed very
      stiffly, and, saying, &ldquo;Senor, I am satisfied,&rdquo; stalked off with all the
      rigidity of one in whose veins flows the sangre azul of Old Castile.
      Freeman smiled superior upon his retreat, and then, producing a
      cigar-case, proceeded to light up with the professor. In this fragrant and
      friendly cloud we will leave them, and return for a few minutes to the
      house of General Trednoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      It will be remembered that something was said of Grace being privy to the
      nocturnal advances of Senor de Mendoza. We are not to suppose that this
      implies in her anything worse than an aptness to indulge in romantic
      adventure: the young lady enjoyed the mystery of romance, and knew that
      serenades, and whisperings over star-lit balconies, were proper to this
      latitude. It may be open to question whether she really was much
      interested in De Mendoza, save as he was a type of the adoring Spaniard.
      That the scene required: she could imagine him (for the time-being) to be
      the Cid of ancient legend, and she herself would enact a role of
      corresponding elevation. Grace would doubtless have prospered better had
      she been content with one adorer at a time; but, while turning to a new
      love, she was by no means disposed to loosen the chains of a former one;
      and, though herself as jealous as is a tiger-cat of her young, she could
      never recognize the propriety of a similar passion on the part of her
      victims. She had been indignant at Freeman&rsquo;s apparent infidelity with
      Miriam; but when she had (as she imagined) discovered her mistake, she had
      listened with a heart at ease to the protestations of Don Miguel. She had
      parted from him that evening with a half expressed understanding that he
      was to reappear beneath her window before day-light; and she had pictured
      to herself a charming balcony-scene, such as she had beheld in Italian
      opera. Accordingly, she had attired herself in a becoming negligee, and
      had spent the fore part of the night somewhat restlessly, occasionally
      emerging on the veranda and gazing down into the perfumed gloom of the
      garden. At length she fancied that she heard footsteps. Whose could they
      be, unless Don Miguel&rsquo;s? Grace retreated within her window to await
      developments. Don Miguel did not appear; but presently she descried a
      phantom-like figure ascending the flight of steps to the veranda. Could
      that be he? If so, he was bolder in his wooing than Grace had been
      prepared for. But surely that was a strange costume that he wore; nor did
      the unconscious harmony of the gait at all resemble the senor&rsquo;s
      self-conscious strut. And whither was he going?
    </p>
    <p>
      It was but too evident that he was going straight to the room occupied by
      Miriam!
    </p>
    <p>
      This was too much for Grace&rsquo;s equanimity. She stepped out of her window,
      and flitted with noiseless step along the veranda. The figure that she
      pursued entered the door of the house, and passed into the corridor
      traversing the wing. Grace was in time to see it cross the threshold of
      Miriam&rsquo;s door, which stood ajar. She stole to the door, and peeped in.
      There was the figure; but of Miriam there was no trace.
    </p>
    <p>
      The figure slowly unfastened and threw back the hood which covered its
      head, at the same time turning round, so that its countenance was
      revealed. A torrent of black hair fell down over its shoulders. Grace
      uttered an involuntary exclamation. It was Miriam herself!
    </p>
    <p>
      The two gazed at each other a moment in silence. &ldquo;Goodness me, dear!&rdquo; said
      Grace at last, in a faint voice, &ldquo;how you have frightened me! I saw you go
      in, in that dress, and I thought you were a man! How my heart beats! What
      is the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is strange!&rdquo; murmured the other, after a pause. &ldquo;I never heard such
      words; and yet I seem to understand, and even to speak them. It must be a
      dream. What are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Miriam, dear! don&rsquo;t you know Grace?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! you think me Miriam. No; not yet!&rdquo; She raised her hands, and pressed
      her fingers against her temples. &ldquo;But I feel her&mdash;I feel her coming!
      Not yet, Kamaiakan! not so soon!&mdash;Do you know him?&rdquo; she suddenly
      asked, throwing back her hair, and fixing an eager gaze on Grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Know who? Kamaiakan? Why, yes&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not him! The youth,&mdash;the blue-eyed,&mdash;the fair beard above
      his lips&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you talking about? Not Harvey Freeman!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harvey Freeman! Ah, how sweet a name! Harvey Freeman! I shall know it
      now!&mdash;Tell him,&rdquo; she went on, laying her hand majestically upon
      Grace&rsquo;s shoulder, and speaking with an impressive earnestness, &ldquo;that
      Semitzin loves him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Semitzin?&rdquo; repeated Grace, puzzled, and beginning to feel scared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Semitzin!&rdquo; the other said, pointing to her own heart. &ldquo;She loves him: not
      as the child Miriam loves, but with the heart and soul of a mighty
      princess. When he knows Semitzin, he will think of Miriam no more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But who is Semitzin?&rdquo; inquired Grace, with a fearful curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Princess of Tenochtitlan, and the guardian of the great treasure,&rdquo;
       was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good gracious! what treasure?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The treasure of gold and precious stones hidden in the gorge of the
      desert hills. None knows the place of it but I; and I will give it to none
      but him I love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you said that... Really, my dear, I don&rsquo;t understand a bit! As for
      Mr. Freeman, he may care for Semitzin, for aught I know; but, I must
      confess, I think you&rsquo;re mistaken in supposing he&rsquo;s in love with you,&mdash;if
      that is what you mean. I met him before you did, you know; and if I were
      to tell you all that we&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you or Miriam to me?&mdash;Ah! she comes!&mdash;The treasure&mdash;by
      the turning of the white pyramid&mdash;six hundred paces&mdash;on the
      right&mdash;the arch&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Her voice died away. She covered her
      face with her hands, and trembled violently. Slowly she let them fall, and
      stared around her. &ldquo;Grace, is it you? Has anything happened? How came I
      like this? What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if you don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m afraid I can&rsquo;t tell you. I had begun to
      think you had gone mad. It must be either that or somnambulism. Who is
      Semitzin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Semitzin? I never heard of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t a man: it&rsquo;s a princess. And the treasure?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I asleep or awake? What are you saying?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The white pyramid, you know&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make game of me, Grace. If I have done anything&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, don&rsquo;t ask me! I tell you frankly, I&rsquo;m nonplussed. You were
      somebody else a minute ago.... The truth is, of course, you&rsquo;ve been
      dreaming awake. Has any one else seen you beside me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I been out of my room?&rdquo; asked Miriam, in dismay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must have been, I should think, to get that costume. Well, the best
      plan will be, I suppose, to say nothing about it to anybody. It shall be
      our secret, dear. If I were you, I would have one of the women sleep in
      your room, in case you got restless again. It&rsquo;s just an attack of
      nervousness, probably,&mdash;having so many strangers in the house, all of
      a sudden. Now you must go to bed and get to sleep: it&rsquo;s awfully late, and
      there&rsquo;ll be ever so much going on to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grace herself slept little that night. She could not decide what to make
      of this adventure. Nowadays we are provided with a name for the peculiar
      psychical state which Miriam was undergoing, and with abundant instances
      and illustrations; but we perhaps know what it is no more than we did
      twenty-five or thirty years ago. Grace&rsquo;s first idea had been that Miriam
      was demented; then she thought she was playing a part; then she did not
      know what to think; and finally she came to the conclusion that it was
      best to quietly await further developments. She would keep an eye on
      Freeman as well as on Miriam; something, too, might be gathered from Don
      Miguel; and then there was that talk about a treasure. Was that all the
      fabric of a dream, or was there truth at the bottom of it? She had heard
      something said about a treasure in the course of the general conversation
      the day before. If there really was a treasure, why might not she have a
      hand in the discovery of it? Miriam, in her abnormal state, had let fall
      some topographical hints that might prove useful. Well, she would work out
      the problem, sooner or later. To-morrow, when the others had gone off on
      their expedition, she would have ample leisure to sound Don Miguel, and,
      if he proved communicative and available, who could tell what might
      happen? But how very odd it all was! Who was Semitzin?
    </p>
    <p>
      While asking herself this question, Grace fell asleep; and by the time the
      summons to breakfast came, she had passed through thrilling adventures
      enough to occupy a new Scheherazade at least three years in the telling of
      them.

      CHAPTER VI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      By nine o&rsquo;clock in the morning, Professor Meschines and Harvey Freeman had
      ridden up to the general&rsquo;s ranch, equipped for the expedition. The
      general&rsquo;s preparations were not yet quite completed. A couple of mules
      were being loaded with the necessary outfit. It was proposed to be out two
      days, camping in the open during the intervening night. It was necessary
      to take water as well as solid provisions. Leaving their horses in the
      care of a couple of stable-boys, Meschines and Freeman mounted the
      veranda, and were there greeted by General Trednoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid we&rsquo;ll have a hot ride of it,&rdquo; he observed. &ldquo;The atmosphere is
      rather oppressive. Kamaiakan tells me there was a touch of earthquake last
      night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought I noticed some disturbance,&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; returned the
      professor, with a stealthy side-glance at Freeman,&mdash;&ldquo;something in the
      nature of an explosion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Earthquakes are common in this region, aren&rsquo;t they?&rdquo; Freeman said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have made it what it is, and may unmake it again,&rdquo; replied the
      general. &ldquo;The earthquake is the father of the desert, as the Indians say;
      and it may some day become the father of a more genial offspring.
      Veremos!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are the young ladies?&rdquo; inquired Freeman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miriam has a little headache, I believe; and I thought Miss Parsloe was
      looking a trifle pale this morning. But you must see for yourself. Here
      they come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grace, who was a little taller than Miriam, had thrown one arm round that
      young lady&rsquo;s waist, with a view, perhaps, to forming a picture in which
      she should not be the secondary figure. In fact, they were both of them
      very pretty; but Freeman had become blind to any beauty but Miriam&rsquo;s.
      Moreover, he was resolved to have some private conversation with her
      during the few minutes that were available. A conversation with the
      professor, and some meditations of his own, had suggested to him a line of
      attack upon Grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you were disturbed by the earthquake last night?&rdquo; he said to
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An earthquake? Why should you think so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You look as if you had passed a restless night. I saw Senor de Mendoza
      this morning. He seems to have had a restless time of it, too. But he is a
      romantic person, and probably, if an earthquake did not make him
      sleepless, something else might.&rdquo; He looked at her a moment, and then
      added, with a smile, &ldquo;But perhaps this is not news to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t come&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t see him,&rdquo; returned Grace, wishing, ere the
      words had left her lips, that she had kept her mouth shut. Freeman
      continued to smile. How much did he know? She felt that it might be
      inexpedient to continue the conversation. Casting about for a pretext for
      retreat, her eyes fell upon Meschines.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, there&rsquo;s the dear professor! I must speak to him a moment,&rdquo; she
      exclaimed, vivaciously; and she slipped her arm from Miriam&rsquo;s waist, and
      was off, leaving Freeman in possession of the field, and of the monopoly
      of Miriam&rsquo;s society.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Trednoke,&rdquo; said he, gravely, &ldquo;I have something to tell you, in order
      to clear myself from a possible misunderstanding. It may happen that I
      shall need your vindication with your father. Will you give it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What vindication do you need, that I can give?&rdquo; asked she, opening her
      dark eyes upon him questioningly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I wish to explain. I am in a difficult position. Would you
      mind stepping down into the garden? It won&rsquo;t take a minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Curiosity, if not especially feminine, is at least human. Miriam descended
      the steps, Freeman beside her. They strolled down the path, amidst the
      flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said, yesterday,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;that I would say one thing and be
      another. Now I am going to tell you what I am. And afterwards I&rsquo;ll tell
      you why I tell it. In the first place, you know, I&rsquo;m a civil engineer, and
      that includes, in my case, a good deal of knowledge about geology and
      things of that sort. I have sometimes been commissioned to make geological
      surveys for Eastern capitalists. Lately I&rsquo;ve been canal-digging on the
      Isthmus; but the other day I got a notification from some men in Boston
      and New York to come out here on a secret mission.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Secret, Mr. Freeman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes: you will understand directly. These men had heard enough about the
      desert valleys of this region to lead them to think that it might be
      reclaimed and so be made very valuable. Such lands can be bought now for
      next to nothing; but, if the theories that control these capitalists are
      correct, they could afterwards be sold at a profit of thousands per cent.
      So it&rsquo;s indispensable that the object of my being here should remain
      unknown; otherwise, other persons might step in and anticipate the designs
      of this company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If those are your orders, why do you speak to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a reason for doing it that outweighs the reasons against it. I
      trust you with the secret: yet I don&rsquo;t mean to bind you to secrecy. You
      will have a perfect right to tell it: the only result would be that I
      should be discredited with my employers; and there is nothing to warrant
      me in supposing that you would be deterred by that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t ask to know your secret: I think you had better say no more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Freeman shook his head. &ldquo;I must speak,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care what
      becomes of me, so long as I stand right in your opinion,&mdash;your
      father&rsquo;s and yours. I am here to find out whether this desert can be
      flooded,&mdash;irrigated,&mdash;whether it&rsquo;s possible, by any means, to
      bring water upon it. If my report is favorable, the company will purchase
      hundreds, or thousands, of square miles, and, incidentally, my own fortune
      will be made.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, that&rsquo;s the very thing&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; She stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The very thing your father had thought of! Yes, so I imagined, though he
      has not told me so in so many words. So I&rsquo;m in the position of
      surreptitiously taking away the prospective fortune of a man whom I
      respect and honor, and who treats me as a friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miriam walked on some steps in silence. &ldquo;It is no fault of yours,&rdquo; she
      said at last. &ldquo;You owe us nothing. You must carry out your orders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but what is to prevent your father from thinking that I stole his
      idea and then used it against him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can tell him the truth: he could not complain; and why should you
      care if he did? I know that men separate business from&mdash;from other
      things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had now come to the little enclosed space where the fountain basin
      was; and by tacit consent they seated themselves upon it. Miriam gave an
      exclamation of surprise. &ldquo;The water is gone!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;How strange!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps it has gone to meet us at our rendezvous in the desert.&mdash;No:
      if I tell your father, I should be unfaithful to my employers. But there&rsquo;s
      another alternative: I can resign my appointment, and let my place be
      taken by another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And give up your chance of a fortune? You mustn&rsquo;t do that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it to you what becomes of me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish nothing but good to come to you,&rdquo; said she, in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never wanted to have a fortune until now. And I must tell you the
      reason of that, too. A man without a fortune does very well by himself. He
      can knock about, and live from hand to mouth. But when he wants to live
      for somebody else,&mdash;even if he has only a very faint hope of getting
      the opportunity of doing it,&mdash;then he must have some settled means of
      livelihood to justify him. So I say I am in a difficult position. For if I
      give this up, I must go away; and if I go away, I must give up even the
      little hope I have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go away,&rdquo; said Miriam, after a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know what you are saying?&rdquo; He hesitated a moment, looking at her
      as she looked down at the empty basin. &ldquo;My hope was that you might love
      me; for I love you, to be my wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The color slowly rose in Miriam&rsquo;s face: at length she hid it in her hands.
      &ldquo;Oh, what is it?&rdquo; she said, almost in a whisper. &ldquo;I have known you only
      three days. But it seems as if I must have known you before. There is
      something in me that is not like myself. But it is the deepest thing in
      me; and it loves you: yes, I love you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her hands left her face, and there was a light in her eyes which made
      Freeman, in the midst of his rejoicing, feel humble and unworthy. He felt
      himself in contact with something pure and sacred. At the same moment, the
      recollection recurred to him of the figure he had seen the night before,
      with the features of Miriam. Was it she indeed? Was this she? To doubt the
      identity of the individual is to lose one&rsquo;s footing on the solid earth.
      For the first time it occurred to him that this doubt might affect Miriam
      herself. Was she obscurely conscious of two states of being in herself,
      and did she therefore fear to trust her own impulses? But, again, love is
      the master-passion; its fire fuses all things, and gives them unity. Would
      not this love that they confessed for each other burn away all that was
      abnormal and enigmatic, and leave only the unerring human heart, that
      knows its own and takes it? These reflections passed through Freeman&rsquo;s
      mind in an instant of time. But he was no metaphysician, and he obeyed the
      sane and wholesome instinct which has ever been man&rsquo;s surest and safest
      guide through the mysteries and bewilderments of existence. He took the
      beautiful woman in his arms and kissed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is real and right, if anything is,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;If there are ghosts
      about, you and I, at any rate, are flesh and blood, and where we belong.
      As to the irrigation scrape, there must be some way out of it: if not, no
      matter! You and I love each other, and the world begins from this moment!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father must know to-morrow,&rdquo; said Miriam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt we shall all know more to-morrow than we do to-day,&rdquo; returned
      her lover, not knowing how abundantly his prophecy would be fulfilled: he
      was over-flowing with the fearless and enormous joy of a young man who has
      attained at one bound the summit of his desire. &ldquo;There! they are calling
      for me. Good-by, my darling. Be yourself, and think of nothing but me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A short ride brought the little cavalcade to the borders of the desert.
      Here, by common consent, a halt was made, to draw breath, as it were,
      before taking the final plunge into the fiery furnace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before we go farther,&rdquo; said General Trednoke, approaching Freeman, as he
      was tightening his girths, &ldquo;I must tell you what is the object of this
      expedition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not necessary, general,&rdquo; replied the young man, straightening
      himself and looking the other in the face; &ldquo;for from this point our paths
      lie apart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why so?&rdquo; demanded the general, in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; exclaimed Meschines, coming up, and adjusting his
      spectacles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not at liberty, at present, to explain,&rdquo; Freeman answered. &ldquo;All I can
      say is that I don&rsquo;t feel justified in assisting you in your affair, and I
      am not able to confide my own to you. I wish you to put the least
      uncharitable construction you can on my conduct. To-morrow, if we all
      live, I may say more; now, the most I can tell you is that I am not
      entirely a free agent. Meantime&mdash;Hasta luego.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Against this unexpected resolve the general cordially protested and the
      professor scoffed and contended; but Freeman stayed firm. He had with him
      provisions enough to last him three days, and a supply of water; and in a
      small case he carried a compact assortment of instruments for scientific
      observation. &ldquo;Take your departure in whatever direction you like,&rdquo; said
      he, &ldquo;and I will take mine at an angle of not less than fifteen degrees
      from it. If I am not back in three days, you may conclude something has
      happened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was certainly very hot. Freeman had been accustomed to torrid suns in
      the Isthmus; but this was a sun indefinitely multiplied by reflections
      from the dusty surface underfoot. Nor was it the fine, ethereal fire of
      the Sahara: the atmosphere was dead and heavy; for the rider was already
      far below the level of the Pacific, whose cool blue waves rolled and
      rippled many leagues to the westward, as, aeons ago, they had rolled and
      rippled here. There was not a breath of air. Freeman could hear his heart
      beat, and the veins in his temples and wrists throbbed. The sweat rose on
      the surface of his body, but without cooling it. The pony which he
      bestrode, a bony and sinewy beast of the toughest description, trod
      onwards doggedly, but with little animation. Freeman had no desire to push
      him. Were the little animal to overdo itself, nothing in the future could
      be more certain than that his master would never see the Trednoke ranch
      again. It seemed unusually hot, even for that region.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was little in the way of outward incident to relieve the monotony of
      the journey. Now and then a short, thick rattlesnake, with horns on its
      ugly head, wriggled out of his path. Now and then his horse&rsquo;s hoof almost
      trod upon a hideous, flat lizard, also horned. Here and there the uncouth
      projections of a cactus pushed upwards out of the dust; some of these the
      mustang nibbled at, for the sake of their juice. Freeman wondered where
      the juice came from. The floor of the desert seemed for the most part
      level, though there was a gradual dip towards the east and northeast, and
      occasionally mounds and ridges of wind-swept dust, sometimes upwards of
      fifty feet in height, broke the uniformity. The soil was largely composed
      of powdered feldspar; but there were also tracts of gravel shingle, of
      yellow loam, and of alkaline dust. In some places there appeared a salt
      efflorescence, sprouting up in a sort of ghastly vegetation, as if death
      itself had acquired a sinister life. Elsewhere, the ground quaked and
      yielded underfoot, and it became necessary to make detours to avoid these
      arid bogs. Once or twice, too, Freeman turned aside lest he should trample
      upon some dry bones that protruded in his path,&mdash;bones that were
      their own monument, and told their own story of struggle, agony,
      exhaustion, and despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      None of these things had any depressing effect on Freeman&rsquo;s spirit. His
      heart was singing with joy. To a mind logically disposed, there was
      nothing but trouble in sight, whether he succeeded or failed in his
      present mission. In the former case, he would find himself in a hostile
      position as regarded the man he most desired to conciliate; in the latter,
      he would remain the mere rolling stone that he was before, and love itself
      would forbid him to ask the woman he loved to share his uncertain
      existence. But Freeman was not logical: he was happy, and he could not
      help it. He had kissed Miriam, and she loved him.
    </p>
    <p>
      His course lay a few degrees north of east. Far across the plain, dancing
      and turning somersaults in the fantastic atmosphere, were the summits of a
      range of abrupt hills, the borders of a valley or ravine which he wished
      to explore. Gradually, as he rode, his shadow lengthened before him. It
      was his only companion; and yet he felt no sense of loneliness. Miriam was
      in his heart, and kept it fresh and bold. Even hunger and thirst he
      scarcely felt. Who can estimate the therapeutic and hygienic effects of
      love?
    </p>
    <p>
      The mustang could not share his rider&rsquo;s source of content, but he may have
      been conscious, through animal instincts whereof we know nothing, of an
      uplifting and encouraging spirit. At all events, he kept up his steady
      lope without faltering or apparent effort, and seemed to require nothing
      more than the occasional wetting which Freeman administered to his nose.
      There would probably be some vegetation, and perhaps water, on the hills;
      and that prospect may likewise have helped him along.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, man and beast may well have welcomed the hour when the
      craggy acclivities of that lonely range became so near that they seemed to
      loom above their heads. Freeman directed his steps towards the southern
      extremity, where a huge, pallid mass, of almost regular pyramidal form,
      reared itself aloft like a monument. He skirted the base of the pyramid,
      and there opened on his view a narrow, winding valley, scarcely half a
      mile in apparent breadth, and of a very wild and savage aspect. Its
      general direction was nearly north and south, and it declined downwards,
      as if seeking the interior of the earth. In fact, it looked not unlike
      those imaginative pictures of the road to the infernal regions described
      by the ancient poets. One could picture Pluto in his chariot, with
      Proserpine beside him, thundering downwards behind his black horses, on
      the way to those sombre and magnificent regions which are hollowed out
      beneath the surface of the planet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Freeman, however, presently saw a sight which, if less spectacularly
      impressive, was far more agreeable to his eyes. On a shelf or cup of the
      declivity was a little clump of vegetation, and in the midst of it welled
      up a thin stream of water. The mustang scrambled eagerly towards it, and,
      before Freeman had had time to throw himself out of the saddle, he had
      plunged his muzzle into the rivulet. He sucked it down with such
      satisfaction that it was evident the water was not salt. Freeman laid
      himself prone upon the brink, and followed his steed&rsquo;s example. The
      draught was cool and pure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know how much I wanted it!&rdquo; said he to himself. &ldquo;It must come
      from a good way down. If I could only bring the parent stream to the
      surface, my mission would be on a fair road to success.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An examination of the spring revealed the fact that it could not have been
      long in existence. Indeed, there were no traces whatever of long
      continuance. The aperture in the rock through which it trickled bore the
      appearance of having been recently opened; fragments were lying near it
      that seemed to have been just broken off. The bed of the little stream was
      entirely free from moss or weeds; and after proceeding a short distance it
      dwindled and disappeared, either sucked up in vapor by the torrid air, or
      absorbed into the dusty soil. Manifestly, it was a recent creation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, to be sure, why not?&rdquo; ejaculated Freeman. &ldquo;There was an earthquake
      last night, which swallowed up the spring in the Trednokes&rsquo; garden:
      probably that same earthquake brought this stream to light. It vanished
      there, to reappear here. Well, the loss is not important to them, but the
      gain is very important to me. It is as if Miriam had come with a cup of
      water to refresh her lover in the desert. God bless her! She has refreshed
      me indeed, soul and body!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He removed the saddle from the mustang, and turned him loose to make the
      best of such scanty herbage as he could find. Then he unpacked his own
      provisions, and made a comfortable meal; after which he rolled a cigarette
      and reclined on the spot most available, to rest and recuperate. The
      valley, or gorge, lay before him in the afternoon light. It was a strange
      and savage spectacle. Had it been torn asunder by some stupendous
      explosion, it could not have presented a rougher or more chaotic aspect.
      To look at it was like beholding the secret places of the earth. The rocky
      walls were of different colors, yellow, blue, and red, in many shades and
      gradations. They towered ruggedly upwards, sharply shadowed and brightly
      lighted, mounting in regular pinnacles, parting in black crevices; here
      and there vast masses hung poised on bases seemingly insufficient, ready
      to topple over on the unwary passer beneath. A short distance to the
      northward the ravine had a turn, and a projecting promontory hid its
      further extreme from sight. Freeman made up his mind to follow it up on
      foot, after the descending sun should have thrown a shadow over it. The
      indications, in his judgment, were not without promise that a system of
      judiciously-applied blastings might open up a source of water that would
      transform this dreadful barrenness into something quite different.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shade of the great pyramid fell upon him as he lay, but the tumultuous
      wall opposite was brilliantly illuminated: the sky, over it, was of a
      peculiar brassy hue, but entirely cloudless. The radiations from the baked
      surface, ascending vertically, made the rocky bastion seem to quiver, as
      if it were a reflection cast on undulating water. The wreaths of
      tobacco-smoke that emanated from Freeman&rsquo;s mouth also ascended, until they
      touched the slant of sunlight overhead. As the young man&rsquo;s eyes followed
      these, something happened that caused him to utter an exclamation and
      raise himself on one arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      All at once, in the vacant air diagonally above him, a sort of shadowy
      shimmer seemed to concentrate itself, which was rapidly resolved into
      color and form. It was much as if some unseen artist had swept a mass of
      mingled hues on a canvas and then had worked them with magical speed into
      a picture. There appeared a breadth of rolling country, covered with
      verdure, and in the midst of it the white walls and long, shadowed veranda
      of an adobe house. Freeman saw the vines clambering over the eaves and
      roof, the vases of earthenware suspended between the pillars and
      overflowing with flowers, the long windows, the steps descending into the
      garden. Now a figure clad in white emerged from the door and advanced
      slowly to the end of the veranda. He recognized the gait and bearing: he
      could almost fancy he discerned the beloved features. She stood there for
      a moment, gazing, as it seemed, directly at him. She raised her hands, and
      pressed them to her lips, then threw them outwards, with a gesture
      eloquent of innocent and tender passion. Freeman&rsquo;s heart leaped:
      involuntarily he stretched out his arms, and murmured, &ldquo;Miriam!&rdquo; The next
      moment, a tall, dark figure, with white hair, wrapped in a blanket, came
      stalking behind her, and made a beckoning movement. Miriam did not turn,
      but her bearing changed; her hands fell to her sides; she seemed
      bewildered. Freeman sprang angrily to his feet: the picture became
      blurred; it flowed into streaks of vague color; it was gone. There were
      only the brassy sky, and the painted crags quivering in the heat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was not a mirage: it was a miracle,&rdquo; muttered the young man to
      himself. &ldquo;Forty miles at least, and it seemed scarcely three hundred
      yards! What does it mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sun sank behind the hills, and a transparent shadow filled the gorge.
      Freeman, uneasy in mind, and unable to remain inactive, filled his canteen
      at the spring, and descended to the rugged trail at the bottom. Clambering
      over boulders, leaping across narrow chasms, letting himself down from
      ledges, his preoccupation soon left him, and physical exertion took the
      precedence. Half an hour&rsquo;s work brought him to the out-jutting promontory
      which had concealed the further reaches of the valley. These now lay
      before him, merging imperceptibly into indistinctness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This atmosphere is unbearable,&rdquo; said Freeman. &ldquo;I must get a little higher
      up.&rdquo; He turned to the right, and saw a natural archway, of no great
      height, formed in the rock. The arch itself was white; the super-incumbent
      stone was of a dull red hue. On the left flank of the arch were a series
      of inscribed characters, which might have been cut by a human hand, or
      might have been a mere natural freak. They looked like some rude system of
      hieroglyphics, and bore no meaning to Freeman&rsquo;s mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sort of crypt or deep recess was hollowed out beneath the arch, the full
      extent of which Freeman was unable to discern. The floor of it descended
      in ridges, like a rough staircase. He stood for a few moments peering into
      the gloom, tempted by curiosity to advance, but restrained partly by the
      gathering darkness, and partly by the oppressiveness of the atmosphere,
      which produced a sensation of giddiness. Something white gleamed on the
      threshold of the crypt. He picked it up. It was a human skull; but even as
      he lifted it it came apart in his hands and crumbled into fragments.
      Freeman&rsquo;s nerves were strong, but he shuddered slightly. The loneliness,
      the silence, the mystery, and the strange light-headedness that was coming
      over him combined to make him hesitate. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come back to-morrow morning
      early,&rdquo; he said to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      As if in answer, a deep, appalling roar broke forth apparently under his
      feet, and went rolling and reverberating up and down the canon. It died
      away, but was immediately followed by another yet more loud, and the
      ground shook and swayed beneath his feet. A gigantic boulder, poised high
      up on the other side of the canon, was unseated, and fell with a terrific
      crash. A hot wind swept sighing through the valley, and the air rapidly
      became dark. Again came the sigh, rising to a shriek, with roarings and
      thunderings that seemed to proceed both from the heavens and from the
      earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      A dazzling flash of lightning split the air, bathing it for an instant in
      the brightness of day: in that instant Freeman saw the bolt strike the
      great white pyramid and splinter its crest into fragments, while the whole
      surface of the gorge heaved and undulated like a stormy sea. He had been
      staggering as best he might to a higher part of the ravine; but now he
      felt a stunning blow on his head: he fell, and knew no more.

      CHAPTER VII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Two horsemen, one of whom led a third horse, carrying a pack-saddle, had
      reached the borders of the desert just as the earthquake began. When the
      first shock came, they were riding past a grove of live-oaks: they
      immediately dismounted, made fast their horses, and lay down beside some
      bushes that skirted the grove. Neither the earthquake nor the storm was so
      severe as was the case farther eastward. In an hour all was over, and they
      remounted and continued their journey, guiding their course by the stars.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was thus that we rode before, Kamaiakan,&rdquo; remarked the younger of the
      two travellers. &ldquo;Yonder bright star stood as it does now, and the hour of
      the night was the same. But this shaking of the earth makes me fear for
      the safety of that youth. The sands of the desert may have swept over him;
      or he may have perished in the hills.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The purposes of the gods cannot be altered, Semitzin,&rdquo; replied the old
      Indian, who perhaps would not have much regretted such a calamity as she
      suggested: it would be a simple solution of difficulties which might
      otherwise prove embarrassing. &ldquo;It is my prayer, at all events, that the
      entrance to the treasure may not be closed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I care nothing for the treasure, unless I may share it with him,&rdquo; she
      returned. &ldquo;Since we spoke together beside the fountain, I have seen him.
      He looked upon me doubtfully, being, perhaps, perplexed because of these
      features of the child Miriam, which I am compelled to wear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Truly, princess, what is he, that you should think of him?&rdquo; muttered
      Kamaiakan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He satisfies my heart,&rdquo; was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I am resolved never again to give up this mortal habitation to her
      you call its rightful owner. I will never again leave this world, which I
      enjoy, for the unknown darkness out of which you called me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Princess, the gods do not permit such dealings. They may, indeed, suffer
      you to live again; but you must return as an infant, in flesh and bones of
      your own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The gods have permitted me to return as I have returned; and you well
      know, Kamaiakan, that, except you use your art to banish me and restore
      Miriam, there is nothing else that can work a change.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Murder is not lawful, Semitzin; and to do as you desire would be an act
      not different from murder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On my head be it, then!&rdquo; exclaimed the princess. &ldquo;Would it be less a
      murder to send me back to nothingness than to let her remain there? Mine
      is the stronger spirit, and has therefore the better right to live. I ask
      of you only to do nothing. None need ever know that Miriam has vanished
      and that Semitzin lives in her place. I wear her body and her features,
      and I am content to wear her name also, if it must be so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kamaiakan was silent. He may well be pardoned for feeling troubled in the
      presence of a situation which had perhaps never before confronted a human
      being. Two women, both tenants of the same body, both in love with the
      same man, and therefore rivals of each other, and each claiming a right to
      existence: it was a difficult problem. The old Indian heartily wished that
      a separate tenement might be provided for each of these two souls, that
      they might fight out their quarrel in the ordinary way. But his magic arts
      did not extend to the creation of flesh and blood. At the same time, he
      could not but feel to blame for having brought this strenuous spirit of
      Semitzin once more into the world, and he was fain to admit that her claim
      was not without justification. His motives had been excellent, but he had
      not foreseen the consequences in which the act was to land him. Yet he
      more shrank from wronging Miriam than from disappointing Semitzin.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the latter was not to be put off by silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There has been a change since you and I last spoke together,&rdquo; she said.
      &ldquo;I am aware of it, though I know not how; but, in some manner, the things
      which Miriam has done are perceptible to me. When I was here before, she
      did but lean towards this youth; now she has given herself to him. She
      means to be united to him; and, if I again should vanish, I should never
      again find my way back. But it shall not be so; and there is a way,
      Kamaiakan, by which I can surely prevent it, even though you refuse to aid
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, princess, I think you mistake regarding the love of Miriam for
      this young man; they have seen little of each other; and it may be, as you
      yourself said, that he has perished in the wilderness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe he lives,&rdquo; she answered: &ldquo;I should know it, were it otherwise.
      But if I cannot have him, neither shall she. I have told you already that,
      unless you swear to me not to put forth your power upon me to dismiss me,
      I will not lead you to the treasure. But that is not enough; for men
      deceive, and you are a man. But if at any time hereafter I feel within me
      those pangs that tell me you are about to separate me from this world, at
      that moment, Kamaiakan, I will drive this knife through the heart of
      Miriam! If I cannot keep her body, at least it shall be but a corpse when
      I leave it. You know Semitzin; and you know that she will keep her word!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She reined in her horse, as she spoke, and sat gazing upon her companion
      with flashing eyes. The Indian, after a pause, made a gesture of gloomy
      resignation. &ldquo;It shall be as you say, then, Semitzin; and upon your head
      be it! Henceforth, Miriam is no more. But do you beware of the vengeance
      of the gods, whose laws you have defied.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let the gods deal with me as they will,&rdquo; replied the Aztecan. &ldquo;A day of
      happiness with the man I love is worth an age of punishment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kamaiakan made no answer, and the two rode forward in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was midnight, and a bright star, nearly in the zenith, seemed to hang
      precisely above the summit of the great white pyramid at the mouth of the
      gorge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was here that we stopped,&rdquo; observed Semitzin. &ldquo;We tied our horses
      among the shrubbery round yonder point. Thence we must go on foot. Follow
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She struck her heels against her horse&rsquo;s sides, and went forward. The long
      ride seemed to have wearied her not a whit. The lean and wiry Indian had
      already betrayed symptoms of fatigue; but the young princess appeared as
      fresh as when she started. Not once had she even taken a draught from her
      canteen; and yet she was closely clad, from head to foot, in the doublet
      and leggings of the Golden Fleece. One might have thought it had some
      magic virtue to preserve its wearer&rsquo;s vitality; and possibly, as is
      sometimes seen in trance, the energy and concentration of the spirit
      reacted upon the body.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned the corner of the pyramid, but had not ridden far when an
      object lying in her path caused her to halt and spring from the saddle.
      Kamaiakan also dismounted and came forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dead body of a mustang lay on the ground, crushed beneath the weight
      of a fragment of rock, which had evidently fallen upon it from a height.
      He had apparently been dead for some hours. He was without either saddle
      or bridle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know him?&rdquo; demanded Semitzin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is Diego,&rdquo; replied Kamaiakan. &ldquo;I know him by the white star on his
      muzzle. He was ridden by the Senor Freeman. They must have come here
      before the earthquake. And there lie the saddle and the bridle. But where
      is Senor Freeman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He can be nowhere else than in this valley,&rdquo; said Semitzin, confidently.
      &ldquo;I knew that I should find him here. Through all the centuries, and across
      all spaces, we were destined to meet. His horse was killed, but he has
      escaped. I shall save him. Could Miriam have done this? Is he not mine by
      right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is at least certain, princess,&rdquo; responded the old man rather dryly,
      &ldquo;that had it not been for Miriam you would never have met the Senor
      Freeman at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank her for so much; and some time, perhaps, I will reward her by
      permitting her to have a glimpse of him for an hour,&mdash;or, at least, a
      minute. But not now, Kamaiakan,&mdash;not till I am well assured that no
      thought but of me can ever find its way into his heart. Come, let us go
      forward. We will find the treasure, and I will give it to my lord and
      lover.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall we bring the pack-horse with us?&rdquo; asked the Indian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, if he can find his way among these rocks. The earthquake has made
      changes here. See how the water pours from this spring! It has already
      made a stream down the valley. It shall guide us whither we are going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Leaving their own horses, they advanced with the mule. But the trail,
      rough enough at best, was now well-nigh impassable. Masses of rock had
      fallen from above; large fissures and crevasses had been formed in the
      floor of the gorge, from some of which steaming vapors escaped, while
      others gave forth streams of water. The darkness added to the difficulties
      of the way, for, although the sky was now clear, the gloom was deceptive,
      and things distant seemed near. Occasionally a heavy, irregular sound
      would break the stillness, as some projection of a cliff became loosened
      and tumbled down the steep declivity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Semitzin, however, held on her way fearlessly and without hesitation, and
      the Indian, with the pack-horse, followed as best he might, now and then
      losing sight for a moment of the slight, grayish figure in front of him.
      At length she disappeared behind the jutting profile of a great promontory
      which formed a main angle of the gorge. When he came up with her, she was
      kneeling beside the prostrate form of a man, supporting his head upon her
      knee.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kamaiakan approached, and looked at the face of the man, which was pale;
      the eyes were closed. A streak of blood, from a wound on the head,
      descended over the right side of the forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he dead?&rdquo; the Indian asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is not dead,&rdquo; replied Semitzin. &ldquo;A flying stone has struck him; but
      his heart beats: he will be well again.&rdquo; She poured some water from her
      canteen over his face, and bent her ear over his lips. &ldquo;He breathes,&rdquo; she
      said. Slipping one arm beneath his neck, she loosened the shirt at his
      throat and then stooped and kissed him. &ldquo;Be alive for me, love,&rdquo; she
      murmured. &ldquo;My life is yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This exhortation seemed to have some effect. The man stirred slightly, and
      emitted a sigh. Presently he muttered, &ldquo;I can&mdash;lick him&mdash;yet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will live, princess,&rdquo; remarked Kamaiakan. &ldquo;But where is the treasure?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My treasure is here!&rdquo; was her reply; and again she bent to kiss the
      half-conscious man, who knew not of his good fortune. After an interval
      she added, &ldquo;It is in the hollow beneath that archway. Go down three paces:
      on the wall at the left you will feel a ring. Pull it outwards, and the
      stone will give way. Behind it lies the chest in which the jewels are. But
      remember your promise!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kamaiakan peered into the hollow, shook his head as one who loves not his
      errand, and stepped in. The black shadow swallowed him up. Semitzin paid
      no further attention to him, but was absorbed in ministering to her
      patient, whose strength was every moment being augmented, though he was
      not yet aware of his position. But all at once a choking sound came from
      within the cave, and in a few moments Kamaiakan staggered up out of the
      shadow, and sank down across the threshold of the arch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Semitzin,&rdquo; he gasped, in a faint voice, &ldquo;the curse of the gods is upon
      the spot! The air within is poisonous. It withers the limbs and stops the
      breath. No one may touch the treasure and live. Let us go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The gods do not love those who fear,&rdquo; replied the princess,
      contemptuously. &ldquo;But the treasure is mine, and it may well be that no
      other hand may touch it. Fold that blanket, and lay it beneath his head. I
      will bring the jewels.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not attempt it: it will be death!&rdquo; exclaimed the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall a princess come to her lover empty-handed? Do you watch beside him
      while I go. Ah, if your Miriam were here, I would not fear to have him
      choose between us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With these words, Semitzin stepped across the threshold of the crypt, and
      vanished in its depths. The Indian, still dizzy and faint, knelt on the
      rock without, bowed down by sinister forebodings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several minutes passed. &ldquo;She has perished!&rdquo; muttered Kamaiakan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Freeman raised himself on one elbow, and gazed giddily about him. &ldquo;What
      the deuce has happened?&rdquo; he demanded, in a sluggish voice. &ldquo;Is that you,
      professor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, a rending and rushing sound burst from the cave. Following it,
      Semitzin appeared at the entrance, dragging a heavy metal box, which she
      grasped by a handle at one end. Immediately in her steps broke forth a
      great volume of water, boiling up as if from a caldron. It filled the
      cave, and poured like a cataract into the gorge. The foundations of the
      great deep seemed to be let loose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Semitzin lifted from her face the woollen mask, or visor, which she had
      closed on entering the cave. She was panting from exertion, but neither
      her physical nor her mental faculties were abated. She spoke sharply and
      imperiously:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bring up the mule, and help me fasten the chest upon him. We must reach
      higher ground before the waters overtake us. And now&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; She
      turned to Freeman, who by this time was sitting up and regarding her with
      stupefaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miriam!&rdquo; was all he could utter.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head, and smiled. &ldquo;I am she who loves you, and whom you will
      love. I give you life, and fortune, and myself. But come: can you mount
      and ride?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t make this out,&rdquo; he said, struggling, with her assistance, to his
      feet. &ldquo;I have read fairy-tales, but this... Kamaiakan, too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Semitzin, meanwhile, brought him to the mule, and half mechanically he
      scrambled into the saddle, the chest being made fast to the crupper.
      Semitzin seized the bridle, and started up the gorge, Kamaiakan bringing
      up the rear. The lower levels were already filling with water, which came
      pouring out through the archway in a full flood, seemingly inexhaustible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see how it is,&rdquo; mumbled Freeman, half to himself. &ldquo;The earthquake&mdash;I
      remember! I got hit somehow. They came from the ranch to hunt me up. But
      where are the general and Professor Meschines? How long ago was it? And
      how came Miriam... Could the mirage have had anything to do with it?&mdash;Here,
      let me walk,&rdquo; he called out to her, &ldquo;and you get up and ride.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned her head, smiling again, but hurried on without speaking. The
      roar of the torrent followed them. Once or twice the mule came near losing
      his footing. Freeman, whose head was swimming, and his brains buzzing like
      a hive of bees, had all he could do to maintain his equilibrium in the
      saddle. He was excruciatingly thirsty, and the gurgling of waters round
      about made him wish he might dismount and plunge into them. But he lacked
      power to form a decided purpose, and permitted the more energetic will to
      control him. It might have been minutes, or it might have been hours, for
      all he knew: at last they halted, near the base of the white pyramid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here we are safe,&rdquo; said Semitzin, coming to his side. &ldquo;Lean on me, my
      love, and I will lift you down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m not quite so bad as that, you know,&rdquo; said Freeman, with a feeble
      laugh; and, to prove it, he blundered off the saddle, and came down on the
      ground with a thwack. He picked himself up, however, and recollecting that
      he had a flask with brandy in it, he felt for it, found it intact, and,
      with an inarticulate murmur of apology, raised it to his lips. It was like
      the veritable elixir of life: never in his life before had Freeman quaffed
      so deep a draught of the fiery spirit. It was just what he wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he felt oddly embarrassed. He did not know what to make of Miriam. It
      was not her strange costume merely, but she seemed to have put on&mdash;or
      put off&mdash;something with it that made a difference in her. She was
      assertive, imperious; as loving, certainly, as lover could wish, but not
      in the manner of the Miriam he knew. He might have liked the new Miriam
      better, had he not previously fallen in love with the former one. He could
      not make advances to her: he had no opportunity to do so: she was making
      advances to him!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My love,&rdquo; she said, standing before him, &ldquo;I have come back to the world
      for your sake. Before Semitzin first saw you, her heart was yours. And I
      come to you, not poor, but with the riches and power of the princes of
      Tenochtitlan. You shall see them: they are yours!&mdash;Kamaiakan, take
      down the chest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that about Semitzin?&rdquo; inquired Freeman. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not aware that I knew
      any such person.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kamaiakan!&rdquo; repeated the other, raising her voice, and not hearing
      Freeman&rsquo;s last words. Kamaiakan was nowhere to be seen. Both Freeman and
      she had supposed that he was following on behind the mule; but he had
      either dropped behind, or had withdrawn somewhere. &ldquo;O Kamaiakan!&rdquo; shouted
      Freeman, as loud as he could.
    </p>
    <p>
      A distant hail, from the direction of the desert, seemed to reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That can&rsquo;t be he,&rdquo; said Freeman. &ldquo;It was at least a quarter of a mile
      off, and the wrong direction, too. He&rsquo;s in the gorge, if he&rsquo;s anywhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hark!&rdquo; said Semitzin.
    </p>
    <p>
      They listened, and detected a low murmur, this time from the gorge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s fallen down and hurt himself,&rdquo; said Freeman. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go after him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a few moments they stumbled upon the old Indian, reclining with his
      shoulders against a rock, and gasping heavily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My princess,&rdquo; he whispered, as she bent over him, &ldquo;I am dying. The
      poisonous air in the cave was fatal to me, though the spell that is upon
      the Golden Fleece protected you. I have done what the gods commanded. I am
      absolved of my vow. The treasure is safe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense! you&rsquo;re all right!&rdquo; exclaimed Freeman. &ldquo;Here, take a pull at
      this flask. It did me all the good in the world!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the old man put it aside, with a feeble gesture of the hand. &ldquo;My time
      is come,&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; said he.&mdash;&ldquo;Semitzin, I have been faithful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Semitzin, again!&rdquo; muttered Freeman. &ldquo;What does it mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what is this?&rdquo; cried the girl, suddenly starting to her feet. &ldquo;I feel
      the sleep coming on me again! I feel Miriam returning! Kamaiakan, have you
      betrayed me at the last?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, princess, I have done nothing,&rdquo; said he, in a voice scarcely
      audible. &ldquo;But, with death, the strength of my will goes from me, and I can
      no longer keep you in this world. The spirit of Miriam claims her rightful
      body, and you must struggle against her alone. The gods will not be
      defied: it is the law!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His voice sank away into nothing, and his beard drooped upon his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s dying, sure enough, poor old chap,&rdquo; said Freeman. &ldquo;But what is all
      this about? I never heard anything like this language you two talk
      together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Semitzin turned towards him, and her eyes were blazing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She shall not have you!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I have won you&mdash;I have saved
      you&mdash;you are mine! What is Miriam? Can she be to you what I could be?&mdash;You
      shall never have him!&rdquo; she continued, seeming to address some presence
      invisible to all eyes but hers. &ldquo;If I must go, you shall go with me!&rdquo; She
      fumbled in her belt, caught the handle of a knife there, and drew it. She
      lifted it against her heart; but even then there was an uncertainty in her
      movement, as if her mind were divided against itself, or had failed fully
      to retain the thread of its purpose. But Freeman, who had passed rapidly
      from one degree of bewilderment to another, was actually relieved to see,
      at last, something that he could understand. Miriam&mdash;for some reason
      best known to herself&mdash;was about to do herself a mischief. He leaped
      forward, caught her in his arms, and snatched the knife from her grasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a few moments she struggled like a young tiger. And it was marvellous
      and appalling to hear two voices come from her, in alternation, or
      confusedly mingled. One said, &ldquo;Let me kill her! I will not go! Keep back,
      you pale-faced girl!&rdquo; and then a lower, troubled voice, &ldquo;Do not let her
      come! Her face is terrible! What are those strange creatures with her?
      Harvey, where are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At last, with a fierce cry, that died away in a shuddering sigh, the form
      of flesh and blood, so mysteriously possessed, ceased to struggle, and
      sank back in Freeman&rsquo;s arms. His own strength was well-nigh at an end. He
      laid her on the ground, and, sitting beside her, drew her head on his
      knee. He had been in the land of spirits, contending with unknown powers,
      and he was faint in mind and body.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet he was conscious of the approaching tread of horses&rsquo; feet, and
      recollected the hail that had come from the desert. Soon loomed up the
      shadowy figures of mounted men, and they came so near that he was
      constrained to call out, &ldquo;Mind where you&rsquo;re going! You&rsquo;ll be over us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; said a voice, which sounded like that of General Trednoke,
      as they reined up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s Kamaiakan, who&rsquo;s dead; and Miriam Trednoke, who has been out of
      her mind, but she&rsquo;s got over it now, I guess; and I,&mdash;Harvey
      Freeman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My daughter!&rdquo; exclaimed General Trednoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My boy!&rdquo; cried Professor Meschines. &ldquo;Well, thank God we&rsquo;ve found you, and
      that some of you are alive, at any rate!&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      As it was still some hours before dawn, and Freeman was too weak to
      travel, it was decided to encamp beside the pyramid till the following
      evening, and then make the trip across the desert in the comparative
      coolness of starlight. Meanwhile, there was something to be done, and much
      to be explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spirit of Kamaiakan had passed away, apparently at the same moment
      that the peculiar case of &ldquo;possession&rdquo; under which Miriam had suffered
      came to an end. They determined to bury him at the foot of the great
      pyramid, which would form a fitting monument of his antique character and
      virtues.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miriam, after her struggle, had lapsed into a state of partial lethargy,
      from which she was aroused gradually. It was then found that she could
      give no account what ever of how or why she came there. The last thing she
      distinctly remembered was standing on the veranda at the ranch and looking
      towards the east. She was under the impression that Kamaiakan had
      approached and spoken with her, but of that she was not certain. The next
      fact in her consciousness was that she was held in Freeman&rsquo;s arms, with a
      feeling that she had barely escaped from some great peril. She could
      recall nothing of the journey down the gorge, of the adventure at the
      bottom of it, or of the return. It was only by degrees that some partial
      light was thrown upon this matter. Freeman knew that he was at the
      entrance of the cave when the earthquake began, and he remembered
      receiving a blow on the head. Consequently it must have been at that spot
      that Miriam and the Indian found him. He had, too, a vague impression of
      seeing Miriam coming out of the cave, dragging the chest; and there, sure
      enough, was a metal box, strapped to the saddle of the pack-mule. But the
      mystery remained very dense. And although the reader is in a position to
      analyze events more closely than the actors themselves could do, it may be
      doubted whether the essential mystery is much clearer to him than it was
      to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We know that the ancient Aztecan priests were adepts in magic,&rdquo; observed
      the professor, &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s natural that some of their learning should have
      descended to their posterity. We have been clever in giving names to such
      phenomena, but we know perhaps even less about their esoteric meaning than
      the Aztecans did. I should judge that Miriam would be what is called a
      good &lsquo;subject.&rsquo; Kamaiakan discovered that fact; and as for what followed,
      we can only infer it from the results. I was always an admirer of
      Kamaiakan; but I must say I am the better resigned to his departure, from
      the reflection that Miriam will henceforth be undisturbed in the
      possession of her own individuality.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As near as I could make out, she called herself Semitzin,&rdquo; put in
      Freeman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Semitzin?&rdquo; repeated the general. &ldquo;Why, if I&rsquo;m not mistaken, there are
      accounts of an Aztecan princess of that name, an ancestress of my wife&rsquo;s
      family, in some old documents that I have in a box, at home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would only add the marvel of heredity to the other marvels,&rdquo; said
      Meschines. &ldquo;Suppose we leave the things we can&rsquo;t understand, and come to
      those we can?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have something to say, General Trednoke,&rdquo; said Freeman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I have already guessed what it may be, Mr. Freeman,&rdquo; returned the
      general, gravely. &ldquo;Old people have eyes, and hearts too, as well as young
      ones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Trednoke,&rdquo; interposed the professor, with a chuckle, &ldquo;your eyes
      might not have seen so much, if I hadn&rsquo;t held the lantern.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love your daughter, and I told her so yesterday morning,&rdquo; went on
      Freeman, after a pause. &ldquo;I meant to tell you on my return. I know I don&rsquo;t
      appear desirable as a son-in-law. But I came here on a commission&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meschines and I have talked it all over,&rdquo; the general said. &ldquo;When an old
      West-Pointer and a professor of physics get together, they are sometimes
      able to put two and two together. And, to tell the truth, I received a
      letter from a member of your syndicate, who is also an acquaintance of
      mine, which explained your position. Under the circumstances, I consider
      your course to have been honorable. You and I were both in search of the
      same thing, and now, as it appears, nature has sent an earthquake to do
      our affair for us. No operations of ours could have achieved such a result
      as last night&rsquo;s disturbance did; and if that do not prove effective,
      nothing else will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it turns out well, I was promised a share in the benefits,&rdquo; said
      Freeman, &ldquo;and that would put me in a rather better condition, from a
      worldly point of view.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After all,&rdquo; interrupted Meschines, &ldquo;you found your way to the spot from
      which the waters broke forth, and may fairly be entitled to the credit of
      the discovery.&mdash;Eh, Trednoke? At any rate, we found nothing.&mdash;Yes,
      I think they&rsquo;ll have to admit you to partnership, Harvey: and Miriam too,&mdash;who,
      by the way, seems to be the only one who actually penetrated into this
      cave you speak of. Maybe the removal of the chest pulled the plug out of
      the bung-hole, as it were: the escape of confined air through such a vent
      would be apt to draw water along with it. By the way, let&rsquo;s have a look at
      this same chest: it looks solid enough to hold something valuable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would like, in the first place, to hear what General Trednoke has to
      say about what I have told him,&rdquo; said Freeman, clearing his throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miriam,&rdquo; said the general, &ldquo;do you wish to be married to this young man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old soldier was sitting with her hand in his, and he turned to her as
      he spoke. She threw her arms round his neck, and pressed her face against
      his shoulder. &ldquo;He is to me what you were to mamma,&rdquo; she said, so that only
      he could hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then be to him what she was to me,&rdquo; answered the general, kissing her.
      &ldquo;Ah me, little girl! I am old, but perhaps this is the right way for me to
      grow young again. Well, if you are of the same mind six months hence&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Worse; it will be much worse, then,&rdquo; murmured the professor. &ldquo;Better make
      it three.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The chest was made of some alloy of steel and nickel, impervious to rust,
      and very hard. It resisted all gentle methods of attack, and it was
      finally found necessary to force the lock with a charge of powder. Within
      was found another case, which was pried open with the point of the
      general&rsquo;s bowie-knife.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was filled to the brim with precious stones, most of them removed from
      their settings. But such of the gold-work as remained showed the jewels to
      be of ancient Aztecan origin. There was value enough in the box to buy and
      stock a dozen ranches as big as the general&rsquo;s, and leave heirlooms enough
      to decorate a family larger than that of the most fruitful of the ancient
      patriarchs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I call that quite a respectable dowry,&rdquo; remarked Meschines. &ldquo;Upon my
      soul, Miriam, if I had known what you had up your sleeve, I should have
      thought twice before allowing a &lsquo;civil engineer&rsquo;&mdash;do you remember?&mdash;to
      run off with you so easily.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At dawn, they prepared the body of old Kamaiakan for its interment. In
      doing this, the professor noted the peculiar appearance of the corpse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The flesh is absolutely withered,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;especially those parts which
      were uncovered. It must have been subjected to the action of some
      destructive vapor or gas, fatal not only to breathe, but to come in
      contact with. I have heard of poisonous emanations proceeding from the
      ground in these regions, but I never saw an instance of their effects
      before. That skull that you say you found, Harvey, was probably that of a
      victim of the same cause. But it is strange that Miriam, who must have
      remained some time in the very midst of it, should have escaped without a
      mark, or even any inconvenience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kamaiakan ascribed it to the magic of the Golden Fleece,&rdquo; said Freeman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; rejoined the other, &ldquo;he may have been right; but, for my part, the
      only magic that I can find in it lies in the fact that it is made of pure
      wool, which undoubtedly possesses remarkable sanative properties; or maybe
      the fiery soul of Semitzin was powerful enough to repel all harmful
      influences. The poor old fellow himself, being clad in cotton, and with no
      soul but his own, was destroyed. Let us wrap him in his blanket, and bid
      him farewell&mdash;and with him, I hope, to all that is uncanny and
      abnormal in the lives of you young folks!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The last rites having been paid to the dead, the party mounted their
      horses and rode out of the gorge on to the long levels of the desert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who come yonder?&rdquo; said Freeman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A couple of Mexicans, I think,&rdquo; said the general.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of them is a woman,&rdquo; said Meschines.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They look very weary,&rdquo; remarked Freeman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miriam fixed her eyes on the approaching pair for a moment, and then said,
      &ldquo;They are Senor de Mendoza and Grace Parsloe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so, indeed, they were; and thus, in this lonely spot, all the dramatis
      personae of this history found themselves united.
    </p>
    <p>
      In answer to the obvious question, how Grace and De Mendoza happened to be
      there, it transpired that, left to their own devices, they had undertaken
      no less an enterprise than to discover the hidden treasure. Grace had
      communicated to the Mexican such bits of information as she had picked up
      and such surmises as she had formed, and he had been able to supplement
      her knowledge to an extent that seemed to justify them in attempting the
      adventure,&mdash;not to mention the fact that Don Miguel (such was the
      ardor of his sentiment for Grace) would, had she desired it, have gone
      with her into a fiery furnace or a den of lions. Grace, who was ambitious
      as well as romantic, and who longed for the power and independence that
      wealth would give, was all alight with the idea of capturing the hoard of
      Montezuma: her social position would be altered at a stroke, and the world
      would be at her feet. Whether she would then have rewarded Don Miguel for
      his devotion, is possibly open to doubt: the sudden acquisition of
      boundless wealth has been known to turn larger heads than hers.
      Fortunately, however, this temptation was withheld from her: so far from
      finding the treasure, she and Don Miguel very soon lost themselves in the
      desert, and had been wandering about ever since, dolely uncomfortable, and
      in no small danger of losing their lives. They were already at the end of
      their last resource when they happened to encounter the other party, as we
      have seen; and immeasurable was their joy at the unlooked-for deliverance.
      So there was another halt, to enable them to rest and recuperate; and it
      was not until the evening of that day that the journey was finally
      resumed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, Grace had time to think over all that happened, and to arrive
      at certain conclusions. She was at bottom a good girl, though liable to be
      led away by her imagination, her vanity, and her temperament. Don Miguel&rsquo;s
      best qualities had revealed themselves to her in the desert: he had always
      thought of her before himself, had done all that in him lay to save her
      from fatigue and suffering, and had stuck to her faithfully when he might
      perhaps have increased his own chances of escape by abandoning her. Did
      not such a man deserve to be rewarded?&mdash;especially as he was a
      handsome fellow, of good family, and possessed of quite a respectable
      income. Moreover, Harvey Freeman was now beyond her reach: he was going to
      marry Miriam, and she had realized that her own brief infatuation for him
      had had no very deep root after all. Accordingly, she smiled encouragingly
      upon Don Miguel, and before they set out on their homeward ride she had
      vouchsafed him the bliss of knowing that he might call her his.
    </p>
    <p>
      The general, as her guardian, did not withhold his approval; but when
      Grace drew him aside and besought him never to reveal to her intended the
      fact that she had once been a shop-girl, the old warrior smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can depend upon me to keep your secret, if you wish it, my dear,&rdquo;
       said he; &ldquo;but I warn you that such concealments between husband and wife
      are not wise. He loves you and would only love you the more for your
      frankness in confessing what you seem to consider a discreditable episode:
      though I for my part am free to tell you that you will be lucky if your
      future life affords you the opportunity of doing anything else so much to
      your credit. But the chances are that he will find it out sooner or later;
      and that may not be so agreeable, either to him or to you. Better tell him
      all now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Grace pictured to herself the aristocratic pride of an hidalgo shocked
      by the suggestion of the plebeianism of trade; and she would not consent
      to the revelation. But the general&rsquo;s prediction was fulfilled sooner than
      might have been expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      For, after they were married, Don Miguel decided to visit the Atlantic
      coast on the wedding journey; and one of the first notable places they
      reached was, of course, New York. Don Miguel was delighted, and was never
      weary of strolling up Fifth Avenue and down Broadway, with his beautiful
      wife on his arm. He marvelled at the vast white pile of the Fifth Avenue
      Hotel; he frowned at the Worth Monument; he stared inexhaustibly into the
      shop-windows; he exclaimed with admiration at the stupendous piles of
      masonry which contained the goods of New York&rsquo;s merchant princes. It
      seemed to be his opinion that the possessors of so much palpable wealth
      must be the true aristocracy of the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      And one afternoon it happened that as they were strolling along Broadway,
      between Twenty-third Street and Union Square, and were crossing one of the
      side-streets, a horse belonging to one of Lord and Taylor&rsquo;s
      delivery-wagons became frightened, and bolted round the corner. One of the
      hind wheels of the vehicle came in contact with Grace&rsquo;s shoulder, and
      knocked her down. The blow and the fall stunned her. Don Miguel&rsquo;s grief
      and indignation were expressed with tropical energy; and a by-stander
      said, &ldquo;Better carry her into the store, mister; it&rsquo;s their wagon run her
      down, and they can&rsquo;t do less than look after her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The counsel seemed reasonable, and Don Miguel, with the assistance of a
      policeman, lifted his wife and bore her into the stately shop. One of the
      floor-walkers met them at the door; he cast a glance at their burden, and
      exclaimed, &ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s Miss Parsloe!&rdquo; And immediately a number of the
      employees gathered round, all regarding her with interest and sympathy,
      all anxious to help, and&mdash;which was what mystified Don Miguel&mdash;all
      calling her by name! How came they to know Grace Parsloe? Nay, they even
      glanced at Don Miguel, as if to ask what was HIS business with the
      beautiful unconscious one!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This lady are my wife,&rdquo; he said, with dignity. &ldquo;She not any more Miss
      Parsloe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Grace has got married!&rdquo; exclaimed the young ladies, one to another;
      and then an elderly man, evidently in authority, came forward and said, &ldquo;I
      suppose you are aware, sir, that Miss Parsloe was formerly one of our
      girls here; and a very clever and useful girl she was. I need not say how
      sorry we are for this accident: I have sent for the physician: but I
      cannot but be glad that the misfortune has at least given me the
      opportunity of telling you how highly your wife was valued and respected
      here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this juncture, Grace opened her eyes: she looked from one face to
      another, and knew that fate had brought the truth to light. But the
      physical shock tempered the severity of the mental one: besides, she could
      not help being pleased at the sight of so many well-remembered and
      friendly faces; and, finally, her husband did not look by any means so
      angry and scandalized as she had feared he would. Indeed, he appeared
      almost gratified. The truth probably was, he was flattered to see his wife
      the centre of so much interest and attention, and at the discovery that
      she had been in some way an honored appanage of so imposing an
      establishment. So, by the time Grace was well enough to be driven back to
      her hotel, the senor was prattling cheerfully and familiarly with all and
      sundry, and was promising to bring his wife back there the next day, to
      talk over old times with her former associates.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was Grace&rsquo;s punishment: it was not very severe; but then her fault
      had been a venial one; and the episode was of much moral benefit to her.
      She liked her husband all the better for having nothing more to conceal
      from him; her vanity was rebuked, and her false pride chastened; and when,
      in after-years, her pretty daughters and black-haired sons gathered about
      her knees, she was wont to warn them sagely against the un-American
      absurdity of fearing to work for their living, or being ashamed to have it
      known.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the married life of Miriam and Harvey Freeman was characteristically
      American in its happiness. The representatives of the oldest and of the
      latest inhabitants of this continent, their union seemed to produce the
      flower of what was best in both. Their wedding is still remembered in that
      region, as being everything that a Southern Californian wedding should be;
      and the bride, as she stood at the altar, looked what she was,&mdash;one
      of those women who, more than anything else in this world, are fitted to
      bring back to earth the gentle splendors of the Garden of Eden. In her
      dark eyes, as she fixed them upon Freeman, there was a mystic light,
      telling of fathomless depths of tenderness and intelligence: it seemed to
      her husband that love had expanded and uplifted her; or perhaps that other
      spirit in her, which had battled with her own, had now become reconciled,
      and therefore yielded up whatever it had of good and noble to aggrandize
      the gentle victory of its conqueror. Somehow, somewhere, in Miriam&rsquo;s
      nature, Semitzin lived; and, as a symbol of the peace and atonement that
      were the issue of her strange interior story, her husband preserves with
      reverence and affection the mysterious garment called the Golden Fleece.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &lsquo;AS-IS&rsquo; WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
